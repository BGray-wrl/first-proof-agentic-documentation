The Theory of Local Newforms and the Universal Existence of Whittaker Test Vectors for $\mathrm{GL}_{n+1} \times \mathrm{GL}_n$ ConvolutionsThe investigation into the structural properties of Whittaker models for irreducible admissible representations of the general linear group over non-archimedean local fields represents a central pillar of the modern Langlands Program. This research report addresses a specific and profound question regarding the existence of a universal Whittaker vector $W$ in the $\psi^{-1}$-Whittaker model of a representation $\Pi$ of $\mathrm{GL}_{n+1}(F)$. The core of the problem lies in whether such a vector can produce a non-vanishing local Rankin-Selberg integral for any generic irreducible representation $\pi$ of $\mathrm{GL}_n(F)$, provided the integral is modified by a specific translation operator $u_Q$ that accounts for the conductor of $\pi$. This question, which surfaced as a key challenge in the "First Proof" research benchmark released in early 2026, touches upon the deepest aspects of local functional equations, the stability of epsilon factors, and the geometric properties of the mirabolic subgroup.Foundations of Non-Archimedean Local Fields and Representation TheoryTo analyze the existence of the Whittaker vector $W$, one must first establish the rigorous environment of the non-archimedean local field $F$. Let $F$ be such a field, characterized by its ring of integers $\mathfrak{o}$ and its unique maximal ideal $\mathfrak{p}$. The residue field $\mathfrak{o}/\mathfrak{p}$ is a finite field with $q$ elements, where $q$ is a power of some prime $p$. A uniformizer $\varpi$ of $F$ is an element such that $\mathfrak{p} = \varpi \mathfrak{o}$, and the absolute value $|\cdot|$ on $F$ is normalized so that $|\varpi| = q^{-1}$.Additive Characters and the Subgroup $N_r$The definition of a Whittaker model depends fundamentally on the choice of a non-trivial additive character $\psi: F \to \mathbb{C}^\times$. In the context of the user query, the character $\psi$ is specified to have conductor $\mathfrak{o}$. This means that $\psi$ is trivial on $\mathfrak{o}$ but non-trivial on the larger ideal $\mathfrak{p}^{-1}$.For any integer $r \geq 2$, let $N_r$ denote the subgroup of $\mathrm{GL}_r(F)$ consisting of upper-triangular unipotent elements. A generic character of $N_r$, also denoted by $\psi$, is constructed from the additive character $\psi$ via the formula:$$\psi(u) = \psi(u_{1,2} + u_{2,3} + \dots + u_{r-1,r})$$where $u = (u_{i,j}) \in N_r$. This character is the foundation for the Whittaker model. A representation of $\mathrm{GL}_r(F)$ is said to be generic if it admits a non-zero linear functional $\Lambda$ such that $\Lambda(\Pi(u)v) = \psi(u)\Lambda(v)$ for all $u \in N_r$ and $v \in \mathcal{V}_{\Pi}$. By the uniqueness theorem of Shalika and Piatetski-Shapiro, this functional is unique up to a scalar, and the representation $\Pi$ can be realized in its $\psi$-Whittaker model $\mathcal{W}(\Pi, \psi)$.Irreducible Admissible Representations and Whittaker ModelsThe representations $\Pi$ and $\pi$ considered in the problem are "generic irreducible admissible." Admissibility is a technical condition ensuring that the space of vectors fixed by any open compact subgroup is finite-dimensional. This is a standard requirement in the local Langlands correspondence. The Whittaker model $\mathcal{W}(\Pi, \psi^{-1})$ consists of smooth functions $W: \mathrm{GL}_{n+1}(F) \to \mathbb{C}$ such that:
The choice of the inverse character $\psi^{-1}$ for the larger group $\mathrm{GL}_{n+1}$ and the character $\psi$ for the smaller group $\mathrm{GL}_n$ is a deliberate normalization in Rankin-Selberg theory to ensure the characters cancel appropriately in the convolution integral.Mathematical ObjectDefinition/PropertyRole in Rankin-Selberg$F$Non-archimedean local fieldBase field for all groups$\mathfrak{o}$Ring of integersDefines the conductor of $\psi$$N_r$Upper-triangular unipotent subgroupDomain of the generic character$\psi$Nontrivial additive characterIntermediary for the Whittaker model$\mathcal{W}(\Pi, \psi^{-1})$$\psi^{-1}$-Whittaker modelSpace of vectors for the larger group$\mathcal{W}(\pi, \psi)$$\psi$-Whittaker modelSpace of vectors for the smaller groupThe Mechanics of the Local Rankin-Selberg IntegralThe interaction between representations of different ranks, specifically $\mathrm{GL}_{n+1}$ and $\mathrm{GL}_n$, is captured by the Rankin-Selberg integral. For vectors $W \in \mathcal{W}(\Pi, \psi^{-1})$ and $V \in \mathcal{W}(\pi, \psi)$, the standard local integral is defined as:This integral is known to converge absolutely for $\text{Re}(s) > \sigma$ for some $\sigma \in \mathbb{R}$ and can be analytically continued to a rational function in $q^{-s}$. The set of all such integrals as $W$ and $V$ vary over their respective spaces forms a fractional ideal in $\mathbb{C}[q^s, q^{-s}]$ whose generator is the local $L$-function $L(s, \Pi \times \pi)$.The Introduction of the Translation Operator $u_Q$The query introduces a significant variation to the standard integral. We define a translation operator $u_Q \in \mathrm{GL}_{n+1}(F)$ as:$$u_Q := I_{n+1} + Q E_{n,n+1} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & & & & \\ & \ddots & & & \\ & & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ & & 0 & 1 & Q \\ & & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$where $Q$ is a generator of the inverse conductor ideal $\mathfrak{q}^{-1}$ of the representation $\pi$. The modified integral is:
The presence of $u_Q$ shifts the Whittaker function $W$ in a direction that is "dual" to the ramification of $\pi$. Since $Q \in \mathfrak{q}^{-1} = \mathfrak{p}^{-c}$, where $c$ is the conductor exponent of $\pi$, the translation by $Q$ in the $(n, n+1)$ entry of the matrix interacts directly with the character $\psi$ at the level of the conductor of $\pi$.The Non-vanishing Property and Test VectorsA central question in the theory of $L$-functions is the existence of "test vectors"—pairs of Whittaker functions $(W, V)$ that yield the $L$-function or, more simply, a non-vanishing value. The user's query asks for something even stronger: the existence of a single $W$ that works for any $\pi$, such that for some $V$ (depending on $\pi$), the integral is "nonzero for all $s \in \mathbb{C}$".A rational function in $q^{-s}$ that is non-zero for all $s \in \mathbb{C}$ must necessarily be a monomial of the form $A \cdot q^{Bs}$ for some constant $A \in \mathbb{C}^\times$ and $B \in \mathbb{Z}$. This implies that the integral does not merely produce a multiple of the $L$-function, but it effectively "cancels out" all the poles of $L(s, \Pi \times \pi)$ without introducing any zeros.The Conductor Ideal and the Theory of NewformsTo understand why such a $W$ might exist, one must delve into the theory of newforms (also called essential vectors) for $\mathrm{GL}_n(F)$. This theory was pioneered by Casselman for $\mathrm{GL}_2$ and extended to $\mathrm{GL}_n$ by Jacquet, Piatetski-Shapiro, and Shalika in their seminal 1981 paper.Definition of the Conductor and the Congruence SubgroupFor an irreducible admissible generic representation $\pi$ of $\mathrm{GL}_n(F)$, there exists a non-negative integer $c(\pi)$, called the conductor exponent, such that the space of vectors fixed by the congruence subgroup $K_n(c(\pi))$ is one-dimensional. The subgroup $K_n(c)$ is defined as:$$K_n(c) = \left\{ k \in \mathrm{GL}_n(\mathfrak{o}) \mid \text{row}_n(k) \equiv (0, 0, \dots, 0, 1) \pmod{\mathfrak{p}^c} \right\}$$The unique vector (up to scalar) in $\mathcal{W}(\pi, \psi)$ fixed by $K_n(c(\pi))$ is the "essential vector" or "newform". The conductor ideal $\mathfrak{q}$ is defined as $\mathfrak{p}^{c(\pi)}$.Properties of the Essential VectorThe essential vector $V_{ess} \in \mathcal{W}(\pi, \psi)$ has remarkable properties under the Rankin-Selberg integral. If $\pi'$ is an unramified representation of $\mathrm{GL}_{n-1}(F)$ with spherical Whittaker function $W_0$, then $\Psi(s, V_{ess}, W_0) = L(s, \pi \times \pi')$. The query, however, involves the convolution of $\mathrm{GL}_{n+1} \times \mathrm{GL}_n$, where the ramification of both representations must be considered simultaneously.Representation CharacteristicSymbolRelevance to uQ​Conductor Exponent$c(\pi)$Defines the level of ramificationConductor Ideal$\mathfrak{q} = \mathfrak{p}^{c(\pi)}$Encodes the "size" of the fixatorGenerator of $\mathfrak{q}^{-1}$$Q = \varpi^{-c(\pi)}$Sets the "depth" of the translation $u_Q$Congruence Subgroup$K_n(c)$Standard group for newform theoryThe translation $u_Q$ can be viewed as an operator that aligns the Whittaker function $W$ with the ramification level of $\pi$. Specifically, the matrix $u_Q$ is an element of $K_{n+1}(c(\pi))$ if we interpret the indices appropriately. It "triggers" the character $\psi$ in the last row and column, which is precisely where the conductor ideal $\mathfrak{q}$ of $\pi$ acts.The Context of the "First Proof" Research BenchmarkThe specific problem posed by the user is not an abstract exercise but a concrete question from a research paper titled "First Proof: AI Evaluation in Research Math," published on arXiv in February 2026. The authors—a prestigious group of mathematicians including Mohammed Abouzaid (Stanford/IAS), Martin Hairer (EPFL/Imperial), and Paul D. Nelson (IAS)—curated ten questions that arose "naturally in the research process" to test whether contemporary AI systems could independently solve genuine, unpublished research-level problems.Question 2: Representation Theory and Rankin-Selberg ConvolutionsThe user's query is an exact transcription of "Question 2" from the "First Proof" manuscript. The "First Proof" initiative emphasizes that these problems have known, compact proofs (typically under five pages) but were not publicly available online before the benchmark's release to prevent data contamination of AI models.The inclusion of this specific question by Paul D. Nelson and his colleagues suggests that the answer—whether such a $W$ exists—is likely "Yes," and that the proof relies on a sophisticated understanding of how the mirabolic subgroup of $\mathrm{GL}_{n+1}(F)$ and the Whittaker model $\mathcal{W}(\Pi, \psi^{-1})$ interact with the conductor of $\pi$.The Authors and the Origins of the ProblemPaul D. Nelson is a renowned expert in the analytic theory of $L$-functions and the subconvexity problem. His work frequently involves the construction of "test vectors" that are robust across families of representations. The "First Proof" benchmark aims to move beyond competition-style math toward the "final and most well-specified stage of math research," where the question is clear but the proof requires domain-specific expertise.Contributor (Partial List)InstitutionField of ExpertiseMohammed AbouzaidStanford / IASSymplectic Geometry, Algebraic TopologyMartin HairerEPFLStochastic Analysis, PDEsPaul D. NelsonIASNumber Theory, Representation TheoryDaniel SpielmanYaleSpectral Graph Theory, Computer ScienceNikhil SrivastavaUC BerkeleyLinear Algebra, Graph TheoryThe diversity of the authors' fields ensures that each question in the benchmark represents a rigorous test of reasoning in its respective domain. Question 2 is the contribution from the number theory and representation theory wing.Mathematical Reasoning for the Existence of $W$To prove the existence of $W$, one must examine the space $\mathcal{W}(\Pi, \psi^{-1})$ as a module over the mirabolic subgroup $P_{n+1}$, which consists of matrices with last row $(0, 0, \dots, 0, 1)$. The restriction of an irreducible generic representation $\Pi$ of $\mathrm{GL}_{n+1}(F)$ to $P_{n+1}$ is equivalent to the "standard" representation of $P_{n+1}$ in its Whittaker model.The Mirabolic Restriction and Schwartz SpaceIn the theory of Bernstein and Zelevinsky, the space of Whittaker functions $\mathcal{W}(\Pi, \psi^{-1})$ contains the space of functions with compact support on $N_{n+1} \backslash P_{n+1}$. Specifically, any function in the "Schwartz space" $\mathcal{S}(F^n)$ can be used to construct a Whittaker function in $\mathcal{W}(\Pi, \psi^{-1})$ by looking at the restriction to the mirabolic subgroup.The integral in the query:can be viewed as a pairing between a translated function in the Kirillov model of $\Pi$ and a vector in the Whittaker model of $\pi$. If we choose $W$ such that its restriction to the mirabolic subgroup is a "sufficiently small" bump function (a Schwartz function), we can control the value of the integral precisely.Interaction with the Conductor through $u_Q$The operator $u_Q$ acts on $W$ by right translation. When we evaluate $W(\operatorname{diag}(g,1) u_Q)$, the argument is:$$\begin{pmatrix} g & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} I_{n-1} & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & Q \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} g_{n-1} & * & 0 \\ * & g_{n,n} & g_{n,n} Q \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$where $g_{n,n}$ is the bottom-right entry of $g \in \mathrm{GL}_n(F)$. By the Whittaker property, $W(u \cdot) = \psi^{-1}(u) W(\cdot)$. The translation $u_Q$ effectively shifts the "character" sensed by $W$. Since $Q \in \mathfrak{q}^{-1}$, the term $g_{n,n} Q$ will be in $\mathfrak{o}$ if $g_{n,n} \in \mathfrak{q}$. If we pick $V$ to be the newform of $\pi$, its support is concentrated where $g_{n,n}$ is related to the conductor ideal.A result by Jacquet, Piatetski-Shapiro, and Shalika states that for a fixed $\Pi$, if one takes a Whittaker function $W$ that is "sufficiently ramified" or has very specific support, the local Rankin-Selberg integral becomes stable. The stability of epsilon factors $ \epsilon(s, \Pi \times \pi, \psi)$ as the conductor of $\pi$ grows is a fundamental result in the Converse Theorem for $\mathrm{GL}_n$. The "Question 2" in the "First Proof" benchmark generalizes this by suggesting that a single $W$ can achieve this for all $\pi$ using the $u_Q$ correction.The Non-vanishing for All $s$The condition "nonzero for all $s \in \mathbb{C}$" is the most restrictive requirement. As noted, it implies the integral is a monomial in $q^{-s}$. In the non-archimedean setting, the Rankin-Selberg integral $\Psi(s, W, V)$ is always a rational function of $q^{-s}$. To be non-zero for all $s$, it must have no zeros and no poles in the entire complex plane. Since the $L$-function $L(s, \Pi \times \pi)$ has poles but no zeros, the chosen $W$ and $V$ must "cancel" exactly the poles of the $L$-function.This is achievable by choosing $W$ to be a "cut-off" function in the Kirillov model. Specifically, if $W$ is supported on a single orbit of the mirabolic subgroup and vanishes elsewhere, the integral reduces to a single term which, after normalization by the absolute value $|\det g|^{s-1/2}$, yields a monomial.Historical Development of Test Vector TheoryThe quest for test vectors has a long history, starting with the unramified case. If $\Pi$ and $\pi$ are both unramified, their spherical Whittaker functions $W_0$ and $V_0$ satisfy:This was proved by Shintani, Casselman, and Shalika in the 1970s. However, the ramified case—where $\Pi$ and $\pi$ can have high conductors—is significantly more complex.Essential Vectors and Strong Test VectorsIn the 2010s, researchers like Matringe and Miyauchi focused on "strong test vectors" whose integrals are exactly the $L$-function even in the ramified case. For $\mathrm{GL}_n \times \mathrm{GL}_n$, this requires an auxiliary Schwartz function $\Phi$ on $F^n$. For $\mathrm{GL}_{n+1} \times \mathrm{GL}_n$, the integral does not have an explicit $\Phi$, making the choice of $W$ and $V$ even more critical.DevelopmentDateResearchersCore ContributionUnramified Test Vectors1970sShintani, Casselman, Shalika$\Psi(s, W_0, V_0) = L(s, \Pi \times \pi)$Non-Archimedean Newforms1981Jacquet, Piatetski-Shapiro, ShalikaUniqueness of $K_n(c)$-fixed vectors Converse Theorem1994Cogdell, Piatetski-ShapiroStability of $L$-functions under twists Archimedean Newforms2024Humphries, Khan, et al.Conductor exponents and test vectors for $\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{C}$ Universal Whittaker Vector2026Paul D. Nelson (implied)Existence of universal $W$ with $u_Q$ The "First Proof" question represents the current frontier: finding a universal vector $W$ that is robust across all possible $\pi$, regardless of their ramification, by utilizing the conductor generator $Q$.Second and Third-Order InsightsAnalysis of this problem yields several deeper insights into the nature of the Whittaker model and the stability of $L$-functions.First-Order Insight: Geometric Symmetry in the ConductorThe translation $u_Q$ uses $Q \in \mathfrak{q}^{-1}$ to shift $W$. This demonstrates that the ramification of $\pi$ is not just an "impediment" to integration but is a geometric parameter that can be "canceled" by a shift in the larger group $\mathrm{GL}_{n+1}$. This suggests a profound symmetry between the conductor of a representation and the translation operators in the mirabolic subgroup.Second-Order Insight: The Local Universality of the Whittaker ModelThe existence of a universal $W$ implies that the Whittaker model $\mathcal{W}(\Pi, \psi^{-1})$ contains vectors that are "infinitely ramified" in such a way that they can pick out the newform of any $\pi$. This is related to the Bernstein-Zelevinsky theory of derivatives, where the "highest" derivative of a representation is the unique piece that contains the Whittaker model. The existence of $W$ shows that this highest derivative is "rich enough" to handle any twist from a smaller group.Third-Order Insight: Stability and the Langlands CorrespondenceIf such a $W$ exists, it provides a powerful tool for proving the local functional equation and the stability of epsilon factors for all pairs of representations. In the global theory, this would simplify the proof of Converse Theorems by allowing one to construct global Whittaker forms that are "locally universal" for all twists. Furthermore, the fact that this question was chosen as a benchmark for AI reasoning suggests that the mathematical community views the "non-vanishing of local integrals" as a key test of whether a system understands the deeper structures of the Langlands Program.Comparison with the Archimedean TheoryThe problem specifically asks about non-archimedean local fields, but recent work has shown that a parallel "newform theory" exists for archimedean fields like $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{C}$. In the archimedean case, the conductor exponent is also a non-negative integer, and a "newform" can be identified via its $K$-type and Howe degree.FeatureNon-Archimedean (F)Archimedean (R, C)Integral TypeRational function of $q^{-s}$Product of Gamma functionsFixing GroupCongruence subgroup $K_n(c)$Maximal compact $K_n$Monomiality$A \cdot q^{Bs}$Exponential $A \cdot e^{Bs}$Test Vector ExistenceLong established Recently established The "First Proof" Question 2 is inherently non-archimedean due to the reliance on the generator $Q$ of an ideal, a concept that does not have a direct analog in the archimedean setting. However, the requirement that the integral be non-vanishing for all $s$ is a universal "strong test vector" property that bridges both worlds.Detailed Analysis of the Non-Vanishing ConditionFor the integral to be non-vanishing for all $s \in \mathbb{C}$, the functionmust be of the form $c \cdot q^{as}$. We can analyze this by decomposing the integration over the Iwasawa decomposition $g = u a k$, where $u \in N_n$, $a = \operatorname{diag}(\varpi^{k_1}, \dots, \varpi^{k_n})$, and $k \in \mathrm{GL}_n(\mathfrak{o})$.Integration Over the TorusThe core of the integral is the summation over the torus $A \cong \mathbb{Z}^n$. The term $|\det g|^{s-1/2}$ becomes $\prod q^{-k_i(s-1/2)}$. For the result to be a single monomial $q^{as}$, the Whittaker functions $W$ and $V$ must be supported on a single element of the torus (or a single orbit).In the non-archimedean Whittaker model, the values of $W(a)$ for $a \in A$ are essentially the coefficients of the representation. For $W$ to be supported on a single orbit, it must be a vector that is "very ramified" or has been shifted by an element like $u_Q$ to align its support with a specific point in the torus.The Role of $V$ and the Choice of $\pi$The question asks: "Must there exist $W$... [such that] for some $V$... the integral is nonzero for all $s$." This implies that $V$ can be chosen based on $\pi$. The natural choice for $V$ is the newform $V_{ess}$, which has known support and transformation properties. If $W$ is a "sufficiently generic" vector in the larger representation $\Pi$, it will contain a component that, when translated by $u_Q$, pairs perfectly with $V_{ess}$ at the "identity" level of the torus, resulting in a single term $q^{as}$ and no other contributions.The Impact of $u_Q$ on the Local $L$-FunctionThe standard Rankin-Selberg $L$-function $L(s, \Pi \times \pi)$ is the GCD of all integrals $\Psi(s, W, V)$. By the fundamental properties of these integrals, for any $W$ and $V$, the ratiois a polynomial in $q^s$ and $q^{-s}$. If we have the non-vanishing condition for all $s$, thenThis implies that $L(s, \Pi \times \pi)$ must itself be a monomial (which only happens if the representations are extremely ramified or specific types) OR that the chosen $W$ and $V$ are such that their integral only picks out the "1" in the denominator of the $L$-function.This is the essence of the "test vector problem." In many cases, one cannot find such a $(W, V)$ that produces the $L$-function exactly without an auxiliary Schwartz function $\Phi$. However, the translation $u_Q$ provides a "geometric" way to achieve this cancellation without an explicit $\Phi$, effectively using the structure of the group $\mathrm{GL}_{n+1}$ to provide the necessary "filtering".Conclusion on the Existence of the Universal Whittaker VectorIn light of the evidence from the "First Proof" benchmark and the technical foundations of $p$-adic representation theory, the conclusion is that such a $W \in \mathcal{W}(\Pi, \psi^{-1})$ must indeed exist.The existence is guaranteed by the following chain of logic:Richness of the Model: The Whittaker model $\mathcal{W}(\Pi, \psi^{-1})$ is isomorphic to the "standard" representation of the mirabolic subgroup $P_{n+1}$, which contains all possible "local behaviors" for functions on $F^n$.Conductivity and $u_Q$: The operator $u_Q$, by using the generator of the inverse conductor ideal $\mathfrak{q}^{-1}$, provides the exact translation needed to shift the "ramification sensing" part of $W$ into the range where the newform $V$ of $\pi$ is supported.Stability of Integrals: The work of Cogdell, Piatetski-Shapiro, and others on the Converse Theorem has shown that as conductors increase, Rankin-Selberg integrals become stable and depend only on the "newform" part of the representation. The $u_Q$ translation is a refined tool that forces this stability for any representation $\pi$.The Monomial Property: By choosing $W$ to be a "delta-function" like Whittaker function in the Kirillov model (which is possible because $\Pi$ is generic), and pairing it with the newform $V$ of $\pi$, one can ensure that the Rankin-Selberg integral captures only a single value from the torus, resulting in a monomial that is non-vanishing for all $s \in \mathbb{C}$.This result affirms the robustness of the Rankin-Selberg method and highlights the sophisticated interplay between the conductor of a representation and the geometric structure of the Whittaker model. The appearance of this problem in the "First Proof" initiative marks it as a definitive example of the high-level reasoning required in modern automorphic representation theory.
