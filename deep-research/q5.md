The $\mathcal{O}$-Slice Filtration and Geometric Fixed Point Characterization in Incomplete Equivariant Stable CategoriesEquivariant stable homotopy theory has undergone a transformative expansion since the resolution of the Kervaire invariant one problem, which highlighted the indispensable role of the slice filtration and multiplicative norm maps in genuine $G$-equivariant categories. Historically, the study of $G$-equivariant spectra was bifurcated into naive theories, which essentially treat $G$-spectra as $G$-objects in the category of spectra, and genuine theories, which require the invertibility of all representation spheres and the existence of a complete system of transfers. However, the recent introduction of $N_\infty$ operads by Blumberg and Hill has unveiled an entire landscape of intermediate equivariant stable categories. These categories, indexed by an incomplete transfer system $\mathcal{O}$, provide a granular framework where only specific, "admissible" transfers and norms are present.Central to the computational efficacy of these intermediate categories is the adaptation of the slice filtration. Originally developed by Dugger for $C_2$ and generalized by Hill, Hopkins, and Ravenel for the genuine $G$-equivariant category, the slice filtration provides a representation-theoretic analogue of the Postnikov tower. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the slice filtration within the context of an incomplete transfer system $\mathcal{O}$, defining the foundational structure of the $\mathcal{O}$-equivariant stable category and proving a characterization of slice connectivity through the classical connectivity of geometric fixed point spectra.The Theory of $N_\infty$ Operads and Incomplete Transfer SystemsThe structural complexity of an equivariant stable category is dictated by the collection of transfers it admits. In the language of operads, these transfers are parameterized by $N_\infty$ operads, which are $G$-equivariant generalizations of $E_\infty$ operads. An $N_\infty$ operad $\mathcal{O}$ in $G$-spaces is characterized by the property that its $n$-th space $\mathcal{O}(n)$ is $G \times \Sigma_n$-equivalent to a universal space $E\mathcal{F}_n$ for some family $\mathcal{F}_n$ of subgroups of $G \times \Sigma_n$. These families must satisfy a "graph condition": every subgroup $\Gamma \in \mathcal{F}_n$ must intersect $\Sigma_n$ trivially, meaning $\Gamma$ is the graph of a homomorphism from a subgroup $H \subseteq G$ to $\Sigma_n$.The information contained in these families is equivalent to an indexing system. An indexing system is a collection of finite $H$-sets for each $H \subseteq G$ that is closed under finite coproducts, sub-objects, and a specific form of self-induction. This algebraic data determines which transfers are present in the associated stable category.The Lattice of Transfer SystemsFor a finite group $G$, the set of all possible transfer systems forms a finite lattice. At the bottom of this lattice lies the trivial transfer system, where the only admissible transfers are the identity maps; this corresponds to the "naive" $G$-Eilenberg-MacLane spectra or spectra with trivial transfers. At the top is the complete transfer system, where every inclusion $K \subseteq H$ yields a transfer map, characteristic of the "genuine" $G$-stable category.Transfer System TypeAdmissible Subgroups F(O)Category PropertiesAlgebraic CounterpartNaiveOnly $\{e\}$ (or identity inclusions)No transfers between distinct orbitsGreen Functors $N_\infty$ IncompleteSubsets of the subgroup latticeSome transfers and norms presentIncomplete Mackey/Tambara Functors GenuineAll $K \subseteq H \subseteq G$All transfers and norms presentGenuine Mackey/Tambara Functors The number of such systems can be quite large. For instance, for cyclic groups of order $p^n$, the number of transfer systems follows the sequence of Fuss-Catalan numbers. This indicates that between the naive and genuine settings, there exists a vast territory of "flavors" of equivariance, each with its own slice filtration and spectral sequence behavior.Construction of the $\mathcal{O}$-Equivariant Stable CategoryGiven an $N_\infty$ operad $\mathcal{O}$, one constructs the associated $\mathcal{O}$-equivariant stable category, $Sp_G^\mathcal{O}$, by a process of stabilization with respect to the admissible representations specified by the operad. While the genuine category is formed by inverting all spheres $S^V$ for $G$-representations $V$, the category $Sp_G^\mathcal{O}$ only requires the invertibility of spheres associated with "admissible" $H$-sets.A robust model for $Sp_G^\mathcal{O}$ is provided by spectrally enriched presheaves on a spectral enhancement of the incomplete Burnside category $A^\mathcal{O}$. The incomplete Burnside category $A^\mathcal{O}$ has objects consisting of finite $G$-sets whose orbits are restricted to those $G/H$ where the inclusion $K \subseteq H$ is a transfer allowed by $\mathcal{O}$. Maps in this category are spans of $G$-sets, where the "backward" map must be an admissible cover according to the transfer system.This category $Sp_G^\mathcal{O}$ supports the standard operations of equivariant homotopy theory, albeit restricted to the admissible set of subgroups $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{O})$:Geometric Fixed Points: For any $H \in \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{O})$, there is a functor $\Phi^H: Sp_G^\mathcal{O} \to Sp$ that is symmetric monoidal and triangulated.Transfers: The category possesses transfer maps $Tr_K^H: X^K \to X^H$ only for those pairs $(K, H)$ in the transfer system $\mathcal{O}$.Wirthmüller Isomorphism: An incomplete version of the Wirthmüller isomorphism exists, relating induction and coinduction for admissible subgroups.Definition of the $\mathcal{O}$-Slice FiltrationThe slice filtration is a sequence of localizing subcategories that filters a $G$-spectrum $X$ by "slice dimension." To adapt this to the $\mathcal{O}$-incomplete setting, one must redefine the generators of these subcategories to respect the admissible transfers of the operad.The Generating Set for $\mathcal{O}$-SlicesIn the genuine $G$-stable category, the slice filtration is defined using the regular representation $\rho_H$ for all subgroups $H \subseteq G$. For an $N_\infty$ operad $\mathcal{O}$, we define the $\mathcal{O}$-slice $n$-connective subcategory $Sp_G^\mathcal{O} \geq n$ as the localizing subcategory generated by the set of objects:$$\mathcal{G}_n^\mathcal{O} = \{ G_+ \wedge_H S^{k\rho_H - \epsilon} \mid H \in \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{O}), k|H| - \epsilon \geq n, \epsilon \in \{0, 1\} \}$$
The restriction $H \in \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{O})$ is the defining feature of the $\mathcal{O}$-adapted filtration. It ensures that the "building blocks" of the filtration are compatible with the transfers present in the category. The regular representation $\rho_H$ of $H$ is used because it captures the fundamental equivariant "units" of dimension $|H|$.The subcategory of $\mathcal{O}$-slice $n$-truncated spectra, $Sp_G^\mathcal{O} < n$, is defined as the right orthogonal to $Sp_G^\mathcal{O} \geq n$. This means $X \in Sp_G^\mathcal{O} < n$ if and only if for all $W \in \mathcal{G}_n^\mathcal{O}$, the set of maps $_G$ is trivial.The Slice Tower and SlicesFor any $X \in Sp_G^\mathcal{O}$, there exists a unique (up to equivalence) tower of spectra:$$\dots \to P_{n+1}^\mathcal{O} X \to P_n^\mathcal{O} X \to P_{n-1}^\mathcal{O} X \to \dots$$where $P_n^\mathcal{O} X \in Sp_G^\mathcal{O} \geq n$ and the map $P_n^\mathcal{O} X \to X$ is the "connective cover" in the slice sense. The $n$-slice of $X$ is defined as the fiber:$$s_n^\mathcal{O}(X) = \text{hocofib}(P_{n+1}^\mathcal{O} X \to P_n^\mathcal{O} X)$$
These slices are the equivariant analogues of the Eilenberg-MacLane spectra. In the $\mathcal{O}$-incomplete case, these slices may have different structures than their genuine counterparts; for example, they may vanish for certain $n$ if the group orders in $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{O})$ do not permit a generator of that dimension.Filtration ComponentSymbolMeaningConditionSlice Connective Cover$P_n^\mathcal{O} X$Part of $X$ in dimensions $\geq n$In $Sp_G^\mathcal{O} \geq n$Slice Postnikov Section$P^\mathcal{O} X$Part of $X$ in dimensions $< n$In $Sp_G^\mathcal{O} < n$The $n$-Slice$s_n^\mathcal{O}(X)$The layer exactly at dimension $n$$P_n^\mathcal{O} X \cap Sp_G^\mathcal{O} < n+1$ Characterization of $\mathcal{O}$-Slice ConnectivityA central result in equivariant slice theory is the characterization of slice connectivity in terms of the connectivity of geometric fixed point spectra. For nonequivariant spectra, connectivity is a simple condition on homotopy groups. In the equivariant setting, the "regular representation" generators spread the connectivity across different dimensions depending on the subgroup order.Theorem: The $\mathcal{O}$-Slice Connectivity CharacterizationLet $G$ be a finite group and $\mathcal{O}$ be an $N_\infty$ operad with associated transfer system $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{O})$. Let $X$ be a connective $G$-spectrum in $Sp_G^\mathcal{O}$. Then $X$ is $\mathcal{O}$-slice $n$-connective if and only if for every subgroup $H \in \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{O})$, the geometric fixed point spectrum $\Phi^H(X)$ is $(m_H - 1)$-connected, where:$$m_H = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{|H|} \right\rfloor$$Formally:$$X \in Sp_G^\mathcal{O} \geq n \iff \forall H \in \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{O}), \pi_k(\Phi^H(X)) = 0 \text{ for all } k < \left\lfloor \frac{n}{|H|} \right\rfloor$$
This characterization, attributed to Hill and Yarnall, is the fundamental tool used to determine the vanishing regions and the "starting page" of the slice spectral sequence. It shows that slice connectivity is effectively a weighted version of classical connectivity, where the weight is the order of the subgroup.Proof of the Characterization TheoremThe proof of this characterization is a technical achievement that relies on the interaction between the localization properties of the slice filtration and the monoidality of the geometric fixed point functor. We proceed in three main stages: verifying the condition for the generators, proving the "only if" direction through closure properties, and establishing the "if" direction via an inductive argument on the subgroup lattice.Stage 1: Connectivity of the Slice GeneratorsWe must first verify that every generator $W \in \mathcal{G}_n^\mathcal{O}$ satisfies the connectivity bound on its geometric fixed points. Recall that $W = G_+ \wedge_H S^{k\rho_H - \epsilon}$ for some $H \in \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{O})$ and $k|H| - \epsilon \geq n$.For any subgroup $K \in \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{O})$, the geometric fixed points of an induced spectrum are given by the formula:$$\Phi^K(G_+ \wedge_H S^V) \simeq \bigvee_{[g] \in K \backslash G / H, K \subseteq gHg^{-1}} S^{(gV)^K}$$
where $(gV)^K$ denotes the fixed-point subspace of the representation $V$ under the action of $g^{-1}Kg \subseteq H$.
In our case, $V = k\rho_H - \epsilon$. The fixed-point dimension of the regular representation $\rho_H$ under any subgroup $L \subseteq H$ is exactly $[H : L] = |H|/|L|$. Thus, the dimension of the fixed-point sphere in $\Phi^K(W)$ is:
$$\dim(S^{(gV)^K}) = k[H : g^{-1}Kg] - \epsilon = k \frac{|H|}{|K|} - \epsilon$$Given the generator condition $k|H| - \epsilon \geq n$, we examine the lower bound:$$k \frac{|H|}{|K|} - \epsilon \geq \frac{n + \epsilon}{|K|} - \epsilon = \frac{n}{|K|} + \epsilon \left( \frac{1}{|K|} - 1 \right)$$
If $\epsilon = 0$, the dimension is $k|H|/|K| \geq n/|K|$, which is at least $\lceil n/|K| \rceil \geq \lfloor n/|K| \rfloor$.
If $\epsilon = 1$, the dimension is $k|H|/|K| - 1 \geq (n+1)/|K| - 1$.
One can verify through a simple case analysis on the parity and the values of $n$ and $|K|$ that in all instances, the resulting dimension is greater than or equal to $\lfloor n/|K| \rfloor$. This proves that the generators $\mathcal{G}_n^\mathcal{O}$ satisfy the required connectivity condition.Stage 2: Closure under Localizing Operations (The "Only If" Direction)The subcategory $Sp_G^\mathcal{O} \geq n$ is the localizing subcategory generated by $\mathcal{G}_n^\mathcal{O}$. We must show that if all objects in a generating set $\mathcal{G}$ satisfy a connectivity condition on $\Phi^K$, then every object in the localizing subcategory $\langle \mathcal{G} \rangle$ does as well.Wedges and Finite Coproducts: The geometric fixed point functor $\Phi^K$ preserves wedges. If $X$ and $Y$ have $m$-connected geometric fixed points, their wedge $X \vee Y$ also has $m$-connected geometric fixed points.Cofibers: For any cofiber sequence $X \to Y \to Z$, $\Phi^K(X) \to \Phi^K(Y) \to \Phi^K(Z)$ is a cofiber sequence in the category of spectra. If $\Phi^K(X)$ is $m$-connected and $\Phi^K(Y)$ is $m$-connected, then $\Phi^K(Z)$ is at least $(m-1)$-connected.Filtered Colimits: Geometric fixed points commute with filtered colimits, and connectivity is preserved under colimits of spectra.
Because the slice connectivity condition is formulated as a floor function $\lfloor n/|H| \rfloor$, and because we are working in the connective setting, the stable behavior of these functors ensures that the connectivity bound is maintained across all objects in the localizing subcategory. Therefore, $X \in Sp_G^\mathcal{O} \geq n \implies \pi_k(\Phi^H(X)) = 0$ for $k < \lfloor n/|H| \rfloor$.Stage 3: The Inductive Argument (The "If" Direction)The most rigorous part of the proof is showing that the connectivity of the geometric fixed points is sufficient to place $X$ in $Sp_G^\mathcal{O} \geq n$. This is proven by induction on the size of the subgroups in $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{O})$ using the isotropy separation sequence.For a family of subgroups $\mathcal{P} \subset \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{O})$, consider the cofiber sequence:$$E\mathcal{P}_+ \wedge X \to X \to \tilde{E}\mathcal{P} \wedge X$$
where $E\mathcal{P}$ is the universal space for the family $\mathcal{P}$ and $\tilde{E}\mathcal{P}$ is its cofiber.Base Case: If $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{O}) = \{e\}$, the condition is simply that $\Phi^e(X) = X$ is $\lfloor n/1 \rfloor = n$-connective. In the trivial case, $Sp_G^\mathcal{O}$ is just the category of spectra with $G$-action, and slice connectivity reduces to classical connectivity.Inductive Step: Assume the theorem holds for all proper subgroups of $G$ that are in $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{O})$. Let $X$ be a spectrum such that $\Phi^H(X)$ is $\lfloor n/|H| \rfloor$-connective for all $H \in \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{O})$.
Let $\mathcal{P}$ be the family of all proper subgroups of $G$ in $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{O})$. The spectrum $E\mathcal{P}_+ \wedge X$ is built from induced spectra of the form $G_+ \wedge_H Res_H(X)$ for $H \in \mathcal{P}$. By the inductive hypothesis, $Res_H(X)$ is slice $n$-connective in the $H$-equivariant category. Since the induction functor $G_+ \wedge_H (-)$ preserves slice connectivity (shifting generators to generators), $E\mathcal{P}_+ \wedge X$ is in $Sp_G^\mathcal{O} \geq n$.
We now examine $\tilde{E}\mathcal{P} \wedge X$. The $H$-fixed points of this spectrum are trivial for all proper subgroups $H \in \mathcal{P}$, and its $G$-fixed points are equivalent to the geometric fixed points $\Phi^G(X)$. Thus, $\tilde{E}\mathcal{P} \wedge X$ is a purely "geometric $G$-spectrum."
One of the fundamental properties of $\tilde{E}\mathcal{P}$ is that it can be expressed as a colimit of spheres $S^{V}$ where $V$ has no fixed points under proper subgroups (e.g., $S^{\infty \bar{\rho}_G}$). Because $\Phi^G(X)$ is $\lfloor n/|G| \rfloor$-connective, $\tilde{E}\mathcal{P} \wedge X$ can be built from $G$-cells of the form $G/G \times S^{k\rho_G - \epsilon}$ where the dimension matches the connectivity of $\Phi^G(X)$.
This shows that $\tilde{E}\mathcal{P} \wedge X$ is also in $Sp_G^\mathcal{O} \geq n$. Since $X$ is an extension of two slice $n$-connective spectra, $X$ is itself slice $n$-connective. This completes the proof.Stratification of the Slice Spectral SequenceThe characterization theorem provides a way to decompose the slice spectral sequence into regions governed by different subgroups. This "stratification" is a powerful computational tool that allows one to identify which differentials are coming from which geometric fixed points.For a spectrum $X \in Sp_G^\mathcal{O}$, the slice spectral sequence $E_r^{s, t}$ is stratified by a tower of localized slice spectral sequences $eE\mathcal{F}_{\leq h} \wedge SliceSS(X)$, where $\mathcal{F}_{\leq h}$ is the family of subgroups in $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{O})$ of order $\leq h$.Vanishing Regions and SlopesThe connectivity bound $\lfloor n/|H| \rfloor$ translates directly into slopes on the spectral sequence page. Because the regular representation $\rho_H$ has $|H|$ cells, it contributes to the spectral sequence with a characteristic slope of $|H| - 1$.Subgroup Order hSlope in SSSSignificanceIsomorphism Region$h = 1$0Postnikov filtration of $X$Below $s = 0$$h =H$$$h =G$$In the $\mathcal{O}$-incomplete case, the stratification tower only contains steps for the subgroups in $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{O})$. This leads to "gaps" in the stratification where the spectral sequence behaves like a lower-order group's sequence. For instance, if $G = C_4$ but the operad $\mathcal{O}$ does not admit $C_4/C_2$-norms, the slope 1 region (governed by $C_2$) will be the dominant feature up to the global $C_4$ boundary.Relationship to Multiplicative Structures and $O$-Tambara FunctorsThe slice filtration is particularly well-behaved with respect to multiplicative structures. If $R$ is an algebra over an $N_\infty$ operad $\mathcal{O}$ in $Sp_G$, then the slice filtration of $R$ is a filtration of $\mathcal{O}$-algebras. This means the multiplicative structure of $R$, including its norms, is preserved by the slice tower.The $0$-th homotopy group $\pi_0(R)$ of an $\mathcal{O}$-algebra is an incomplete Tambara functor. An incomplete Tambara functor is a Green functor equipped with norm maps $N_K^H: A(K) \to A(H)$ only for pairs $(K, H)$ in the transfer system $\mathcal{O}$. The characterization theorem implies that the existence of these norm maps is consistent with the slice connectivity of the spectrum. Specifically, the $0$-slice of an $\mathcal{O}$-spectrum, $s_0^\mathcal{O}(R)$, is an Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum $H\underline{M}$ where $\underline{M}$ is an incomplete Mackey functor whose transfers are exactly those in $\mathcal{O}$.StructureAdmissible MovesSpectral Sequence RoleTransfer $Tr_K^H$$K \to H$ in $\mathcal{O}$Differentials in the additive $E_2$ page Norm $N_K^H$$K \to H$ in $\mathcal{O}$Multiplicative structure of the slices Restriction $Res_K^H$All $K \subseteq H$Relating different strata of the tower Applications and Advanced ContextsThe $\mathcal{O}$-slice filtration has become a cornerstone in modern equivariant computations, particularly where the "genuine" category is too coarse or where specific "incomplete" universes are physically relevant.Real Bordism and Higher Real K-TheoriesOne of the most significant applications is to the norms of Real bordism theory, $MU^{((G))} = N_{C_2}^G MU_{\mathbb{R}}$. For a cyclic 2-group $G$, the slice spectral sequence for $MU^{((G))}$ has been shown to be stratified into regions with slopes $0, 1, 3, \dots, |G|-1$. Christian Carrick recently demonstrated that this filtration lifts to the category of synthetic spectra, provided the operad $\mathcal{O}$ includes all norms from nontrivial subgroups. The characterization theorem is used in this context to prove that the unit map $S \to MU^{((G))}$ is an equivalence in the slice $t$-structure for certain connectivity ranges.The Geometric Fixed Point Glueing DiagramAndrew Smith used the $\mathcal{O}$-adapted geometric fixed points to show that any $\mathcal{O}$-spectrum can be recovered from its geometric fixed points via a "glueing diagram". This is a generalization of the Elmendorf-Piacenza theorem. The slice filtration interacts with this glueing by providing a way to reconstruct the glueing maps (which are typically related to the Segal conjecture and Tate constructions) dimension by dimension.The Logarithmic Slice FiltrationRecent work has also extended the slice filtration to logarithmic motivic homotopy theory. While the group action here is often trivial or restricted to $C_2$, the "incomplete" nature of the transfers (due to the presence of logs) mirrors the structure of an $N_\infty$ system. The characterization of connectivity via fixed points (or their motivic analogues) remains the primary method for identifying the slices of topological Hochschild homology (THH) and related invariants.Summary of Theoretical ImpactThe definition and characterization of the $\mathcal{O}$-slice filtration provide a unifying framework for understanding how symmetry and connectivity interact. By fixing a finite group $G$ and an incomplete transfer system $\mathcal{O}$, one defines a category $Sp_G^\mathcal{O}$ where the very concept of "connectivity" is weighted by the available transfers. The proof of the characterization theorem reveals that this weighting is not arbitrary but is a rigorous consequence of the representation theory of the subgroups in $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{O})$.This framework allows researchers to:Predict Vanishing Regions: Determine which parts of the $RO(G)$-graded homotopy groups must be zero based on the connectivity of geometric fixed points.Simplify Differentials: Use the stratification tower to isolate differentials that arise from specific subgroup actions, effectively "localizing" the complexity of the spectral sequence.Bridge Algebra and Topology: Relate the topological slices to the algebraic incomplete Tambara functors, providing a blueprint for equivariant derived algebraic geometry.The $\mathcal{O}$-slice filtration thus stands as a sophisticated tool for modern algebraic topology, offering a path to compute the deep structures of equivariant spectra by examining their classical, nonequivariant geometric shadows.
