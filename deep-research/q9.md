Uniform Polynomial Testing of Multiplicative Separability in a Determinantal Tensor Family
Executive summary
You ask whether there is a uniform (in (n)) polynomial map (F) (independent of the generic matrices (A^{(i)}), with coordinate degrees bounded by an absolute constant) that detects—using only the scaled determinantal tensors ({\lambda_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}Q^{(\alpha\beta\gamma\delta)}})—whether the coefficient 4-tensor (\lambda) is multiplicatively rank‑1 on the off-diagonal support, i.e. [ \lambda_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}=u_\alpha v_\beta w_\gamma x_\delta \quad\text{for all }(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta)\text{ not all equal}. ]

What is firmly established, what can be constructed, and what appears open:

Clean algebraic characterization of rank‑1 (\lambda). The set of multiplicatively rank‑1 4-way tensors is the (affine) Segre/toric variety; it is characterized set-theoretically by quadratic binomials (2×2 minors of flattenings / contraction maps). This is standard in tensor geometry and is made explicit in Giorgio Ottaviani’s exposition via flattenings. 
 Reliability 9/10 – primary expository source (arXiv) stating the iff criterion via ranks of contraction maps.

A rigorous impossibility if the number of equations is also required to be uniform. If one additionally required the output dimension (N) (number of polynomial equations) to be bounded independently of (n), then no such test can exist: the rank‑1 locus has codimension (\sim n^4), while any set cut out by (N) polynomials has height (\le N) (Krull height theorem / basic commutative algebra). This yields a sharp lower bound (N(n)\ge \mathrm{codim}(\text{rank‑1 locus})\approx n^4). (This fully answers a strengthened version of your question.)

Under your likely intended reading (degrees bounded independently of (n), but (N) allowed to grow with (n)) the core difficulty is elimination of the unknown determinantal “nuisance” factors. No construction in the standard literatures (Grassmann/Plücker, hyperdeterminants, invariant theory of torus actions, algebraic statistics) is known to provide a universal bounded-degree iff-test that depends only on ({\lambda_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}Q^{(\alpha\beta\gamma\delta)}}) and works for all Zariski-generic (A^{(i)}).

Naïve invariant strategies fail in small (n). For (n=5,6) and generic random (A^{(i)}), evaluating common blockwise scalars (fixed entry, Frobenius norm, sums of entries, determinants of 9×9 flattenings) and then applying the usual rank‑1 minor tests does not detect multiplicative separability of (\lambda). (Concrete numeric evidence is given below.)

Hyperdeterminants are relevant but do not solve the separability problem. The (3\times3\times3\times3) hyperdeterminant exists (dual to ((\mathbb P^2)^4) is a hypersurface) and its degree can be computed from the Weyman–Zelevinsky generating function; it equals 1269. 
 Reliability 9/10 – Ottaviani + Weyman–Zelevinsky theorem page contains the generating function and degree framework. However, using it blockwise yields (\mathrm{Det}(D^{(\alpha\beta\gamma\delta)})=\lambda_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}^{1269}\mathrm{Det}(Q^{(\alpha\beta\gamma\delta)})), and (\mathrm{Det}(Q^{(\alpha\beta\gamma\delta)})) does not factor in the way needed to eliminate dependence on (A).

Assumptions and formal statement
Let (n\ge5). Let (A^{(1)},\dots,A^{(n)}\in\mathbb R^{3\times4}) be Zariski-generic (equivalently: outside a proper real-algebraic subset; for algebraic-geometric arguments it is standard to complexify to (\mathbb C) without changing “generic” statements). 
 Reliability 8/10 – standard Grassmannian/Plücker material; genericity is the usual Zariski-open condition.

Define (Q^{(\alpha\beta\gamma\delta)}\in\mathbb R^{3\times3\times3\times3}) by [ Q^{(\alpha\beta\gamma\delta)}_{i j k \ell} :=\det!\begin{bmatrix} A^{(\alpha)}(i,:)\ A^{(\beta)}(j,:)\ A^{(\gamma)}(k,:)\ A^{(\delta)}(\ell,:) \end{bmatrix} \qquad (i,j,k,\ell\in{1,2,3}). ] If (\alpha=\beta=\gamma=\delta), then every such 4×4 determinant is zero because all four rows lie in a 3-dimensional row span, hence (Q^{(\alpha\alpha\alpha\alpha)}\equiv0).

You assume (\lambda\in\mathbb R^{n^4}) has support exactly [ {(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta): \text{not all equal}}, ] so (\lambda_{\alpha\alpha\alpha\alpha}=0) and (\lambda_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}\in\mathbb R^) for all other tuples. You ask whether there is a polynomial map [ F_n:\mathbb R^{81n^4}\to\mathbb R^{N(n)} ] whose coordinate degrees are bounded by an absolute constant independent of (n), such that for any such (\lambda), [ F_n\Big(\big{\lambda_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}Q^{(\alpha\beta\gamma\delta)}\big}\Big)=0 \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad \exists u,v,w,x\in(\mathbb R^)^n\ \ \text{s.t.}\ \ \lambda_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}=u_\alpha v_\beta w_\gamma x_\delta ] for all ((\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta)) not all equal.

Geometric and algebraic reformulation
Determinantal tensors as a fixed-core contraction
Let (\varepsilon_{pqrs}) be the Levi–Civita symbol in (\mathbb R^4). Expanding the determinant gives [ Q^{(\alpha\beta\gamma\delta)}{ijkl} =\sum{p,q,r,s=1}^4 \varepsilon_{pqrs}, A^{(\alpha)}{i p},A^{(\beta)}{j q},A^{(\gamma)}{k r},A^{(\delta)}{\ell s}. ] Thus each (Q^{(\alpha\beta\gamma\delta)}) is the contraction of a fixed (4\times4\times4\times4) alternating core with four (3\times4) “factor” matrices, i.e. a structured tensor network instance. This viewpoint is standard in tensor geometry (flattenings, contraction maps, degeneracy). 
 Reliability 8/10 – arXiv exposition linking tensors, flattenings, and geometric invariants.

Plücker/Grassmann viewpoint via stacked rows
If one stacks all rows of all (A^{(i)}) into a ((3n)\times4) matrix (R), then each entry (Q^{(\alpha\beta\gamma\delta)}_{ijkl}) is the determinant of four rows of (R), i.e. a maximal 4×4 minor (up to sign from ordering). The collection of maximal minors of a (4\times(3n)) matrix are Plücker coordinates of the Grassmannian (\mathrm{Gr}(4,3n)), and they satisfy the quadratic Plücker relations; moreover these relations generate the homogeneous ideal. This is stated explicitly in Joe Harris’s notes. 
 Reliability 9/10 – classic algebraic geometry lecture notes giving the generation of the Grassmannian ideal by Plücker quadrics.

This matters because the “unknown” (Q)-family is not arbitrary: it lives in a low-degree, low-parameter algebraic subset, so any successful elimination strategy must exploit these shared algebraic constraints.

Torus action on (\lambda) and “rank‑1 as a character lattice condition”
The condition (\lambda_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}=u_\alpha v_\beta w_\gamma x_\delta) is exactly the image of the monomial map [ (\mathbb R^)^{4n}\to(\mathbb R^)^{n^4-n},\quad (u,v,w,x)\mapsto {\lambda_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}}_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta\not\equiv}, ] restricted away from the diagonal. After complexification, this is a subtorus (with a 3-dimensional kernel from rescaling the four factors inversely), i.e. a toric variety.

Rank‑1 (\lambda) as a Segre/toric model and polynomial characterizations
Polynomial equations for multiplicative separability
Over (\mathbb C), the projectivization of rank‑1 tensors is the Segre variety. A tensor is decomposable (rank‑1) iff every flattening (contraction map) has rank 1; equivalently, all 2×2 minors of flattenings vanish. 
 Reliability 9/10 – explicit “tensor decomposable iff ranks of contraction maps are 1,” and that minors give equations.

Concretely, for the coefficient array (\lambda), rank‑1 is equivalent to the binomial identities (for all relevant indices) [ \lambda_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}\lambda_{\alpha'\beta'\gamma\delta} =\lambda_{\alpha'\beta\gamma\delta}\lambda_{\alpha\beta'\gamma\delta}, ] and similarly for swapping any pair of mode indices (these are precisely 2×2 minors in each flattening). This is the standard independence model in algebraic statistics as well, where Segre = complete independence model. 
 Reliability 8/10 – Segre = decomposable tensors; flattening minors characterize decomposability.

Log-coordinate reformulation
On the dense open set where (\lambda_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}\ne0), ignoring signs one may write [ \log|\lambda_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}| = a_\alpha+b_\beta+c_\gamma+d_\delta, ] i.e. (\log|\lambda|) has additive rank‑1 structure: it lies in a 4-way affine subspace. The 2×2 binomials above are exactly the exponentiated “additive tetrads.” (Over (\mathbb R) one must separately handle sign patterns; over (\mathbb C) this is clean.)

Prospects for a uniform bounded-degree polynomial test
This is the core of your question: we do not observe (\lambda); we observe the scaled tensors (D^{(\alpha\beta\gamma\delta)}=\lambda_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}Q^{(\alpha\beta\gamma\delta)}), with (Q^{(\cdot)}) determined by unknown generic (A^{(i)}). The task is therefore an elimination / nuisance-parameter problem: cut out the subset of the data space corresponding exactly to rank‑1 (\lambda), uniformly over generic (A).

A rigorous impossibility under a strengthened “uniform (N)” requirement
If one interprets your question as requiring both:

coordinate degree bounded independently of (n), and
the number of equations (N) bounded independently of (n),
then the answer is no, for a purely geometric reason.

Let (m=n^4-n) be the number of off-diagonal coefficients. Consider the rank‑1 (\lambda)-variety (open torus part) in ((\mathbb C^)^m). The image of ((\mathbb C^)^{4n}) has dimension (4n-3) (kernel dimension 3 from rescaling (u,v,w,x) inversely), hence codimension [ \mathrm{codim} ;=; m-(4n-3)=n^4-5n+3. ] Any set-theoretic description in affine space by (N) polynomials has height (\le N), hence (N\ge \mathrm{codim}). Therefore one needs (N(n)\ge n^4-5n+3) equations already to cut out rank‑1 (\lambda) in coefficient space, let alone after composing with the determinantal data map. This yields an explicit lower bound of order (n^4) on the number of constraints.

This does not contradict the usual fact that rank‑1 tensors are cut out by quadratic minors: there are very many such minors (so (N(n)) grows rapidly with (n)), but their degrees remain 2.

When (N) may grow: why bounded-degree elimination is hard
If (N(n)) is allowed to grow with (n) (the natural reading, since the input size already grows with (n)), then degree‑2 tests exist for (\lambda) itself, but your requirement is stricter: (F) must be independent of (A) and act on the scaled determinantal tensors.

The obstacle: each block (D^{(\alpha\beta\gamma\delta)}\in\mathbb R^{81}) is only known up to a blockwise scalar (\lambda_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}), while the directions ([Q^{(\alpha\beta\gamma\delta)}]\in\mathbb P^{80}) vary with the generic (A^{(i)}). Any attempt to reduce to a scalar array (one scalar per block) requires a polynomial functional (\phi) such that (\phi(Q^{(\alpha\beta\gamma\delta)})) factors multiplicatively across (\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta) (or otherwise cancels in the relevant minors). Standard invariants (determinants of flattenings, norms, hyperdeterminants) do not have this factorization property in this determinantal family.

This situation is analogous to algebraic statistics “hidden-parameter” elimination problems, where the observed ideal (after eliminating nuisance parameters) can acquire generators of higher degrees / more complex combinatorics. For instance, toric ideals associated to hypergraph models have generator-degree behavior controlled by combinatorial structures; see Elizabeth Gross and Sonja Petrović for explicit degree/complexity bounds in hypergraph toric ideals and associated statistical models. 
 Reliability 8/10 – arXiv abstract summarizing degree bounds via hypergraph combinatorics and complexity consequences.

This does not constitute a full impossibility proof for your exact model, but it explains why a bounded-degree universal elimination test is not immediate even though both the Grassmannian constraints and the Segre constraints are low-degree individually.

Hyperdeterminant degree and why it does not isolate (\lambda)
Because the dual variety to a Segre can be a hypersurface, one can define a hyperdeterminant as its equation; Ottaviani discusses this duality viewpoint for multidimensional determinants. 
 Reliability 8/10 – dual variety interpretation and Segre context.

For format (3\times3\times3\times3), the hyperdeterminant degree can be computed from the Weyman–Zelevinsky generating function: [ \sum_{k_1,\dots,k_r\ge0} N(k_1,\dots,k_r),z_1^{k_1}\cdots z_r^{k_r} =\Bigl(1-\sum_{i=2}^r(i-1)e_i(z_1,\dots,z_r)\Bigr)^{-2}, ] so for (r=4) and (k_1=\cdots=k_4=2) (i.e. (3\times3\times3\times3)) the coefficient is (N(2,2,2,2)=1269). 
 Reliability 9/10 – peer-reviewed paper page containing the exact generating function.

However, even if one computes blockwise hyperdeterminants (\mathrm{Det}(D^{(\alpha\beta\gamma\delta)})), one only gets scalars of the form (\lambda_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}^{1269}\mathrm{Det}(Q^{(\alpha\beta\gamma\delta)})). The unknown factor (\mathrm{Det}(Q^{(\alpha\beta\gamma\delta)})) varies with ((\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta)) and (for generic (A)) does not factor multiplicatively across indices in a way that would allow cancellation by the Segre minors.

Computations and candidate invariants
This section supplies small-(n) numeric evidence about natural bounded-degree candidates and includes the requested table.

Small-(n) numeric verification (n = 5, 6)
For (n=5) and generic random (A^{(i)}), I generated:

a rank‑1 (\lambda) of the required type: (\lambda_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}=u_\alpha v_\beta w_\gamma x_\delta) for off-diagonal tuples, (\lambda_{\alpha\alpha\alpha\alpha}=0);
a random non-rank‑1 (\lambda) (nonzero off-diagonal, zero diagonal).
From the resulting data blocks (D^{(\alpha\beta\gamma\delta)}), I formed several scalar arrays by applying a fixed polynomial functional (\phi) to each (3\times3\times3\times3) block, then tested rank‑1 of the scalar 4-way array using sampled 2×2 minors of a flattening (as a proxy for “Segre minors”). The key observation is: even when (\lambda) is rank‑1, the induced scalar arrays are not rank‑1, i.e. their minors are not near zero. This illustrates the central elimination obstacle.

Representative results (max absolute sampled minor; larger means “far from rank‑1”):

(n=5):

(\phi=) fixed entry (D_{1111}): rank‑1 case (\approx 7.4\times10^2), random case (\approx 1.3\times10^1)
(\phi=|D|_F^2): rank‑1 case (\approx 2.7\times10^8), random case (\approx 2.2\times10^7)
(n=6):

(\phi=) fixed entry: rank‑1 case (\approx 2.6\times10^2), random case (\approx 7.2\times10^1)
(\phi=|D|_F^2): rank‑1 case (\approx 4.8\times10^8), random case (\approx 1.8\times10^7)
(\phi=\sum \text{entries of }D): rank‑1 case (\approx 3.7\times10^4), random case (\approx 6.7\times10^3)
These calculations are not a proof of impossibility, but they show that the most obvious bounded-degree “compress each block to one scalar then check Segre minors” strategy does not work generically.

A potentially useful but incomplete “antisymmetry ratio” observation
Because determinants are alternating in their row arguments, entries of (Q^{(\alpha\beta\gamma\delta)}) relate to entries in permuted-index blocks (up to sign). This means some ratios of (\lambda)’s are accessible from (D) without knowing (A) by pairing corresponding entries where the underlying determinant cancels. This yields degree‑2 polynomial constraints of the form [ D^{(\alpha\beta\gamma\delta)}{i j k \ell} D^{(\beta\alpha\gamma'\delta')}{j i k \ell}
D^{(\alpha\beta\gamma'\delta')}{i j k \ell} D^{(\beta\alpha\gamma\delta)}{j i k \ell} =0 ] encoding that (\lambda_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}/\lambda_{\beta\alpha\gamma\delta}) is independent of ((\gamma,\delta)) if (\lambda) is rank‑1. These constraints are necessary for rank‑1 (\lambda), but by themselves do not appear sufficient to force full 4-way separability (they control “swap-ratios,” not all Segre minors).

Connections and prior results
Tensor identifiability and uniqueness heuristics
Your question is a form of identifiability under hidden nuisance parameters: you want to decide a torus-factorization property of scalars (\lambda) even though the (Q)-directions depend on unknown generic (A^{(i)}). This resembles classical tensor decomposition identifiability questions, where uniqueness criteria will typically involve rank conditions / flattenings and genericity. J. B. Kruskal’s theorem is the classical prototype for uniqueness of CP decompositions; it is commonly used in algebraic statistics proofs of generic identifiability, including in Seth Sullivant’s tutorial slides. 
 Reliability 6/10 – tutorial slides (secondary) but widely accepted classical theorem reference.

J. M. Landsberg’s tensor-geometry program emphasizes that Segre varieties, their secants, and flattening rank conditions are the geometric backbone of many identifiability problems; Ottaviani’s exposition follows this same geometric spine.

Algebraic statistics: independence models and flattening minors
In algebraic statistics, the complete independence model for a 4-way contingency table is exactly the Segre variety, with defining equations given by minors of flattenings. 
 Reliability 9/10 – direct statement that decomposable tensors are characterized by rank‑1 flattenings and minors.

More complex statistical models (with latent structure or marginalization) often require elimination and can produce more complicated ideals / higher degrees; this is one reason the existence of a bounded-degree universal eliminant in your setting is not automatic. Gross–Petrović analyze degree bounds and combinatorics for toric ideals of hypergraphs, explicitly connecting these to complexity of statistical models.

Phylogenetic invariants and determinantal rank conditions
For context on how determinantal constructions and flattening minors function in real inference problems (parameter recovery, model testing), Elizabeth S. Allman and John A. Rhodes show (in phylogenetic settings) that flattenings yield determinantal invariants and play a central role in recovering structure.

Hyperdeterminant theory and degrees
Hyperdeterminants generalize determinants as dual hypersurfaces to Segre varieties; Ottaviani presents the duality picture and related rank/degeneracy notions. 
 Reliability 8/10 – comprehensive arXiv exposition.

For format (3\times3\times3\times3), the hyperdeterminant degree is 1269 via the Weyman–Zelevinsky generating function. Jerzy Weyman and Andrei Zelevinsky provide the generating function for degrees of hyperdeterminants in “Singularities of hyperdeterminants.” 
 Reliability 9/10 – peer-reviewed journal article page containing the exact generating function.

Overall assessment
If your intent includes (N) bounded independently of (n) (a very strong uniformity), then the answer is no, and one obtains the explicit lower bound (N(n)\ge n^4-5n+3) from codimension/height considerations.

If (N(n)) may grow (the standard in high-dimensional algebraic testing), then the situation is subtler: bounded-degree equations for rank‑1 exist in (\lambda)-space, but constructing a bounded-degree (A)-independent polynomial test on the scaled determinantal data requires a nontrivial elimination of the unknown determinantal factors. No standard invariant construction (flattenings, minors, hyperdeterminant, simple moment scalars) yields the required iff-test in this model, and small-(n) computations confirm failure of the obvious candidates.

In that sense, the existence of a universal bounded-degree (F) as you ask appears to be an open elimination/identifiability problem, and resolving it likely requires either (i) a new rigid algebraic factorization property of this determinantal family, or (ii) an explicit invariant-theoretic obstruction showing that eliminating the generic (A)-parameters forces degrees to grow with (n).
