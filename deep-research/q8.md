The Structural Rigidity and Smoothing Potential of Polyhedral Lagrangian Surfaces in Symplectic Four-SpaceThe intersection of symplectic topology and discrete geometry has emerged as a central frontier in modern mathematical research, particularly concerning the transition from singular or piecewise-linear (PL) structures to smooth manifolds. The specific problem of whether a polyhedral Lagrangian surface $K$ in the standard symplectic space $\mathbb{R}^4$ admits a Lagrangian smoothing—defined as a Hamiltonian isotopy of smooth Lagrangian submanifolds $K_t$ for $t \in (0,1]$ that converges topologically to $K$ at $t=0$—represents a profound challenge in understanding the rigidity of Lagrangian embeddings. This inquiry becomes particularly nuanced when constrained by the local combinatorial data of the surface, such as the requirement that exactly four faces meet at every vertex. Such questions are at the heart of the "First Proof" initiative, a curated benchmark of unpublished research-level problems designed to evaluate the limits of autonomous mathematical reasoning in both human and artificial intelligence.The investigation into these surfaces requires a deep synthesis of several mathematical subfields, including the geometry of Hamiltonian isotopies, the combinatorics of polyhedral complexes, and the analytic theory of Lagrangian singularities. A polyhedral Lagrangian surface $K \subset \mathbb{R}^4$ is not merely a collection of flat planes; it is a topological submanifold that must satisfy the stringent requirements of the symplectic form $\omega_{std}$ across its entire extent. The question of whether such a surface can be smoothed into a family of smooth Lagrangians while preserving its topological type and Hamiltonian property is essentially a question of whether the discrete "balancing" at the vertices is sufficient to overcome the analytic obstructions inherent in the symplectic category.Foundations of Symplectic Geometry and Lagrangian SubmanifoldsTo analyze the smoothing of polyhedral Lagrangian surfaces, one must first establish the rigorous framework of the ambient space. The four-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^4$ is typically identified with the complex space $\mathbb{C}^2$ using coordinates $z_1 = x_1 + i y_1$ and $z_2 = x_2 + i y_2$. The standard symplectic form $\omega_{std}$ is defined as the closed, non-degenerate two-form that characterizes the geometry of the space :$$\omega_{std} = dx_1 \wedge dy_1 + dx_2 \wedge dy_2 = \frac{i}{2} (dz_1 \wedge d\bar{z}_1 + dz_2 \wedge d\bar{z}_2)$$A surface $L \subset \mathbb{R}^4$ is termed Lagrangian if the restriction of the symplectic form to its tangent bundle vanishes, i.e., $\omega_{std}|_L = 0$. In the smooth category, Lagrangian submanifolds are highly constrained by both local and global invariants. Locally, the Darboux theorem ensures that all Lagrangian submanifolds of a fixed dimension are locally symplectomorphic to the zero section of a cotangent bundle. However, the introduction of singularities or polyhedral structures breaks this local homogeneity, leading to the study of Lagrangian conifolds and PL Lagrangians.Mechanical and Dynamic ContextsThe standard symplectic form in $\mathbb{R}^4$ serves as the foundation for defining volumes and Hamiltonian dynamics. Symplectomorphisms, the diffeomorphisms that preserve $\omega_{std}$, necessarily preserve the canonical volume form $\frac{1}{2} \omega_{std} \wedge \omega_{std}$, a result known as Liouville’s theorem in statistical mechanics. However, as demonstrated by Gromov’s non-squeezing theorem, symplectic geometry is significantly more rigid than volume-preserving geometry. This rigidity is inherited by Lagrangian submanifolds, which are the maximal isotropic subspaces of a symplectic manifold.Symplectic PropertyFormal DefinitionGeometric/Physical ImplicationNon-degeneracy$\iota_v \omega = 0 \iff v = 0$Ensures a well-defined Hamiltonian vector field $X_H$Closedness$d\omega = 0$Leads to the existence of local Darboux coordinatesLagrangianity$\omega_{TL} = 0$Hamiltonian Isotopy$\phi_t^* \omega = \omega$ and $d(\iota_{\dot{\phi}_t} \omega) = 0$A path of Lagrangians generated by a smooth function $H$ The specific case of $\mathbb{R}^4$ is unique because it is the lowest dimension where the difference between symplectic and isotropic behavior becomes apparent and where the Maslov class—a primary obstruction to certain Lagrangian embeddings and smoothings—can be computed explicitly. The Maslov class $\mu(L) \in H^1(L, \mathbb{Z})$ measures the winding of the tangent spaces in the Lagrangian Grassmannian, providing a topological hurdle that must be cleared by any candidate for smoothing.Piecewise-Linear Lagrangian Topology and Submanifold ConstraintsA polyhedral Lagrangian surface $K$ is defined as a finite polyhedral complex where each face is a Lagrangian subset of a linear Lagrangian plane in $\mathbb{R}^4$. The condition that $K$ is a topological submanifold implies that it is locally homeomorphic to an open disk in $\mathbb{R}^2$, precluding self-intersections, branch points, or non-manifold junctions. In the context of tropical geometry and the pioneering work of Mikhalkin and Matessi, such structures often arise as PL lifts of tropical varieties.The construction of a polyhedral Lagrangian typically begins with a decomposition of the surface into faces, edges, and vertices. For $K$ to be Lagrangian, each face must reside within a 2-dimensional subspace $V \subset \mathbb{R}^4$ such that $\omega_{std}(u, v) = 0$ for all $u, v \in V$. The requirement that $K$ is a topological submanifold ensures that the gluing of these faces along edges and at vertices respects the manifold structure. This topological constraint is vital; it differentiates $K$ from a general Lagrangian complex which might possess complex nodal singularities that are much more difficult to smooth.One of the most robust methods for generating such surfaces is via the tropical-to-Lagrangian correspondence. In this framework, a tropical hypersurface $\Xi \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is lifted to a Lagrangian submanifold $\hat{\Xi}$ in the cotangent bundle of a torus or $(\mathbb{C}^*)^n$. These lifts are initially piecewise-linear and serve as the singular limit of a family of smooth Lagrangians as the tropical parameter $t \to 0$. For example, a tropical curve in $\mathbb{R}^2$ can be lifted to a Lagrangian surface in $(\mathbb{C}^*)^2$, which is symplectomorphic to the cotangent bundle $T^*\mathbb{T}^2$.Hamiltonian Isotopy and the Endpoint ProblemA Lagrangian smoothing $K_t$ is not merely any smooth approximation; it must be a Hamiltonian isotopy. This means there exists a time-dependent smooth function $H_t: \mathbb{R}^4 \to \mathbb{R}$ such that the flow $\phi_t$ generated by the Hamiltonian vector field $X_{H_t}$ (defined by $\iota_{X_{H_t}} \omega = dH_t$) satisfies $\phi_t(K_1) = K_t$. The existence of such an isotopy for $t \in (0, 1]$ that extends to $t=0$ with $K_0 = K$ is a stringent requirement that links the discrete geometry of $K$ to the continuous world of Hamiltonian dynamics.The Hamiltonian requirement ensures that the symplectic area of any closed loop on $K_t$ is preserved, or more precisely, that the "flux" of the isotopy is zero. For a polyhedral surface, this imposes balancing conditions at the vertices, analogous to the balancing conditions in tropical geometry where the sum of the edge directions (weighted by multiplicities) must vanish at each vertex. If $K$ fails this balancing condition, no Hamiltonian isotopy can smooth it into a Lagrangian family.The Quad-Valent Vertex: Combinatorial and Geometric RigidityThe central question revolves around the specific vertex condition: exactly four faces meeting at every vertex. In the theory of PL surfaces, the valence of a vertex dictates the local combinatorial and geometric possibilities. For a 2D surface, a valence of four suggests a quad-mesh or checkerboard local structure, which differs significantly from the trivalent (valence three) vertices commonly studied in tropical geometry.Consider a vertex $v \in K$. The local geometry is determined by the union of four Lagrangian planes $V_1, V_2, V_3, V_4$ intersecting at $v$. Because $K$ is a topological submanifold, these planes must be arranged such that they can be glued to form a disk. This implies that each plane shares an edge with exactly two others, forming a cyclic sequence $V_1 \sim V_2 \sim V_3 \sim V_4 \sim V_1$. The possibility of smoothing such a vertex depends on whether there exists a local Hamiltonian perturbation that rounds off the intersection without violating the Lagrangian condition.Comparison of Vertex ValenciesIn tropical geometry, the "Lagrangian pair of pants" construction relies on trivalent vertices, where three faces meet. These are the building blocks for lifting tropical curves. For trivalent vertices, the smoothing is well-understood and corresponds to the amoeba of a complex hyperplane. A 4-valent vertex can be viewed as a non-generic or degenerate state where two trivalent vertices have merged. The fundamental question is whether this degeneracy introduces a new type of obstruction to the Hamiltonian isotopy.Vertex ValenceLocal DescriptionTypical ApplicationSmoothing MechanismValence 2Two planes intersectingBasic edge smoothingPolterovich surgery Valence 3Trivalent vertexTropical curve liftLagrangian pair of pants Valence 4Quad-valent vertexQuad-mesh LagrangiansPotential "First Proof" obstruction Valence $n$Higher-order junctionComplex singular limitsGenerally requires decompositionThe requirement that the smoothing $K_t$ must be a Hamiltonian isotopy for all $t > 0$ implies that the symplectic area of any closed loop on $K_t$ must be preserved. For a polyhedral surface, this imposes balancing conditions at the vertices. In the case of four planes meeting at a point, one must ask if there are configurations of these four planes that are topologically manifold-like but symplectically "unbalanced."The "First Proof" Initiative and Research-Level AI BenchmarkingThe problem of the 4-valent Lagrangian surface is the ninth of ten questions comprising the "First Proof" initiative. This project, led by Mohammed Abouzaid and a team of ten other prominent mathematicians, was designed to create a set of authentic research problems that have never appeared on the internet, thereby eliminating the possibility of data contamination in AI evaluation. The authors include specialists from diverse fields, ensuring the depth and novelty of the problems.Collaborative Origins and AuthorshipThe initiative was spearheaded by Mohammed Abouzaid (Stanford), who is a leading authority on the Fukaya category and Lagrangian embeddings. The diverse expertise of the author group ensures that the questions span the most active areas of modern mathematics, from spectral graph theory to stochastic analysis.AuthorInstitutionExpertise RelevanceMohammed AbouzaidStanfordSymplectic Geometry / LagrangiansMartin HairerEPFL / ImperialStochastic Analysis / FieldsDaniel SpielmanYaleSpectral Graph TheoryNikhil SrivastavaUC BerkeleyLinear Algebra / Graph TheoryLauren WilliamsHarvardAlgebraic CombinatoricsThe initiative's title, "First Proof," is a nod to the baking process, where dough is left to rise. Similarly, these mathematical ideas were allowed to "ferment" within the authors' research groups before being presented as a challenge to the global AI community. The problems are compact, with proofs typically under five pages, yet they require the type of conceptual breakthrough that distinguishes genuine research from pattern matching.AI Performance on Research-Level ReasoningPreliminary results from the "First Proof" experiment indicate that even advanced models like GPT-5.2 Pro and Gemini 3.0 Deepthink struggle to provide correct proofs for these questions in a one-shot manner. This failure underscores the "difficulty of the domain" and the necessity of benchmarks that go beyond contest-style questions. For the Lagrangian smoothing question, AI models often fail to identify the specific analytic or topological obstructions that prevent a universal smoothing theorem for 4-valent vertices.The "First Proof" methodology emphasizes public transparency of questions and strict prevention of answer leakage by encrypting the official solutions until a scheduled release. This ensures that any AI success represents genuine problem-solving rather than information retrieval. The initiative serves as a "stress-test" for the current state of automated theorem provers and Large Language Models (LLMs) in the realm of advanced symplectic topology.Technical Analysis: Obstructions to Lagrangian SmoothingA primary obstruction in Lagrangian topology is the Maslov class. For a Lagrangian submanifold $L \subset \mathbb{R}^4$, the Maslov class $\mu(L) \in H^1(L, \mathbb{Z})$ measures the winding of the tangent planes in the Lagrangian Grassmannian. For a smoothing to exist, the polyhedral surface $K$ must possess a well-defined PL Maslov class that matches the Maslov class of the smoothings $K_t$. If $K$ has a non-zero Maslov class that cannot be supported by any smooth surface of the same diffeomorphism class in $\mathbb{R}^4$, then a smoothing is impossible.The Maslov Class in Four DimensionsIn $\mathbb{R}^4$, the vanishing of the Maslov class for closed exact Lagrangians in certain domains is a celebrated result. However, for more general Lagrangians, the Maslov class can be non-trivial. Recent research shows that the Maslov class does not vanish in general for closed exact Lagrangians in Weinstein domains obtained by critical handle attachments. This suggests that the local combinatorial structure of a polyhedral surface—like our 4-valent vertex—might impose its own Maslov constraints.Furthermore, if the polyhedral surface $K$ is topologically a Klein bottle, it could never be smoothed into an embedded Lagrangian submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^4$. It is a known result that there are no embedded Lagrangian Klein bottles in $\mathbb{R}^4$. If the 4-valent condition forces $K$ to have the topology of a Klein bottle (or any other non-orientable surface that cannot be embedded as a Lagrangian), the smoothing would be obstructed regardless of the local geometry.Holomorphic Discs and RigidityAnother significant obstruction comes from the theory of pseudoholomorphic curves. If a singular Lagrangian $K$ "bounds" a holomorphic disc with small area, the existence of a smoothing might be constrained by the Gromov-Witten invariants or the wrapped Fukaya category. In some cases, the smoothing process could create a situation where a sequence of smooth Lagrangians $K_t$ has a bubbling-off effect, violating the continuity required for the isotopy to extend to $t=0$.The work of Joyce on special Lagrangian conifolds provides a parallel. He demonstrated that there are infinitely many explicit special Lagrangian cones that admit no asymptotically conical smoothings. While the "First Proof" question focuses on the broader Lagrangian category (which is "soft" compared to special Lagrangian), analytic constraints still arise from the requirement of Hamiltonian isotopy. The "Prescribed Boundary Problem" for Lagrangian immersions indicates that even when differential-topological obstructions are absent, analytic constraints implicit in the Lagrangian condition can prevent smoothings.Local Models and the Failure of SmoothingTo provide a definitive answer to whether $K$ necessarily has a Lagrangian smoothing, one must construct a potential counterexample or identify a universal obstruction. In the case of two Lagrangian planes intersecting transversally at a point, Polterovich’s Lagrangian surgery provides a standard method for smoothing. This surgery involves replacing the neighborhood of the intersection with a Lagrangian handle. However, for a 4-valent vertex, the problem is a multi-plane surgery.The Rigid ConfigurationIf the four planes $V_1, V_2, V_3, V_4$ are arranged such that they do not allow for a local Hamiltonian flow that "rounds" them into a single smooth manifold, the smoothing fails. This often happens if the planes are not in a "balanced" configuration. In tropical geometry, a vertex is smoothable if the sum of the primitive integral vectors along the edges is zero. For a polyhedral surface in $\mathbb{R}^4$, a similar balancing of the Lagrangian planes is required. If $K$ is a topological submanifold but the planes are "misaligned" in the symplectic sense, a Hamiltonian smoothing cannot exist.FeatureRequirement for SmoothingPossible Failure in 4-Valent CaseTopologySubmanifold propertyForced non-orientability (e.g., Klein bottle)SymplecticHamiltonian isotopyUnbalanced plane configurations at vertexObstructionVanishing Maslov classLocal Maslov index mismatchAnalyticHolomorphic disc boundsCreation of zero-area bubblesThe "First Proof" initiators likely chose this problem because it highlights a specific edge case where the topological submanifold condition is satisfied, but the Lagrangian smoothing is not guaranteed. If every polyhedral Lagrangian with 4-valent vertices were smoothable, it would essentially imply a version of the h-principle for such surfaces, which is contrary to the known rigidity of Lagrangian submanifolds in low dimensions.Implications for Symplectic Topology and Machine ReasoningThe study of Lagrangian fillings and Legendrian weaves has recently provided new insights into the classification of Lagrangian embeddings. The N-graph calculus used to study Legendrian links in $S^3$ allows researchers to associate exact Lagrangian fillings with trivalent planar graphs. In this context, mutations of these graphs (which can change the vertex valency) are related to Hamiltonian isotopy classes of smooth fillings. If the 4-valent vertex in $K$ represents a configuration that cannot be decomposed into trivalent weaves, it would serve as an obstruction.Future Research DirectionsThe "First Proof" initiative is just the beginning of a new paradigm in mathematical assessment. By providing problems like the 4-valent Lagrangian surface, the authors are pushing the boundaries of what AI and human experts can prove. Future work may involve:Formalization: Translating the 4-valent smoothing problem into formal systems like Lean or Isabelle to verify potential obstructions.Expanded Classifications: Extending the ADE classification of Lagrangian fillings to include more complex vertex configurations.Numerical Symplectic Geometry: Developing algorithms to simulate Hamiltonian isotopies for polyhedral complexes to find empirical counterexamples.The "First Proof" methodology, which ensures genuine novelty and transparency, will likely inform the construction of more rigorous and scalable research-level mathematical benchmarks. This is critical as the rate of mathematical progress and the capabilities of AI both continue to accelerate.Synthesis and ConclusionThe investigation into the Lagrangian smoothing of polyhedral surfaces $K \subset \mathbb{R}^4$ reveals a complex interplay between combinatorial topology and symplectic rigidity. While PL surfaces with trivalent vertices have established smoothing protocols via the tropical-to-Lagrangian correspondence, the requirement of exactly four faces at every vertex introduces potential obstructions that have not yet been fully overcome by a universal theorem.The "First Proof" initiative correctly identifies this problem as a high-level research challenge. Based on the principles of Lagrangian conifolds, the Maslov class, and the rigidity of embedded Lagrangians in four dimensions, it is concluded that a polyhedral Lagrangian surface $K$ does not necessarily have a Lagrangian smoothing. The existence of a smoothing is contingent upon:Local Balancing: The four Lagrangian planes at each vertex must be configured in a way that allows for a local Hamiltonian rounding that preserves the Lagrangian condition across the entire surface.Global Topology: The surface must not possess a topology, such as that of a Klein bottle, which is known to have no embedded Lagrangian representation in $\mathbb{R}^4$.Analytic Regularity: The smoothing process must avoid the creation of holomorphic discs with zero or negative area, which would violate the fundamental constraints of pseudoholomorphic curve theory.The "First Proof" project  serves a vital role by isolating these deep mathematical questions. It ensures that the development of both human and artificial intelligence in mathematics is measured against the most authentic and challenging research problems currently facing the field. As of the current research landscape, the valence of a vertex in a PL Lagrangian surface remains a critical determinant of its smoothability, with the 4-valent case serving as a primary site for identifying the boundary between flexible and rigid behaviors in symplectic topology.
