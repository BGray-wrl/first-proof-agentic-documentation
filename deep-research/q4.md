Information-Theoretic Foundations of Finite Free Probability and the Polynomial Stam InequalityThe mathematical discipline of finite free probability represents a transformative bridge between the discrete world of algebraic combinatorics and the continuous, non-commutative realm of Voiculescu’s free probability theory. At the heart of this intersection lies the study of real-rooted polynomials and their behavior under specific operations known as finite free convolutions. These operations are not merely formal manipulations of coefficients but are deeply rooted in the spectral geometry of random matrices and the information-theoretic properties of interacting particle systems. One of the most profound questions in this field concerns the behavior of Fisher information—a measure of a distribution’s sensitivity or "irregularity"—under the symmetric additive convolution of polynomials. This report explores the definition of finite free Fisher information, the structural mechanics of the symmetric additive convolution $\boxplus_n$, and the theoretical proof of the Stam-like inequality for real-rooted polynomials, establishing a subadditive property for the information power of their zeros.The Theoretical Genesis of Finite Free ConvolutionThe symmetric additive convolution, denoted by $\boxplus_n$, serves as a finite-dimensional analogue to the free additive convolution used to describe the sum of freely independent non-commutative random variables. While free probability traditionally operates in the limit as the dimension $N$ of random matrices tends to infinity, finite free probability provides a framework for understanding the expected behavior of polynomials at a fixed degree $n$. The genesis of this operation is found in the study of the expected characteristic polynomial of the sum of two Hermitian matrices, $A$ and $B$, where one matrix is conjugated by a random unitary matrix $U$ sampled from the Haar measure on the unitary group $U(n)$.The formal definition provided in the research query characterizes the convolution of two monic polynomials $p(x) = \sum_{k=0}^n a_k x^{n-k}$ and $q(x) = \sum_{k=0}^n b_k x^{n-k}$ through their coefficients. The resulting polynomial $(p \boxplus_n q)(x) = \sum_{k=0}^n c_k x^{n-k}$ features coefficients $c_k$ defined by the weighted sum:$$ c_k = \sum_{i+j=k} \frac{(n-i)! (n-j)!}{n! (n-k)!} a_i b_j $$
This formula possesses a remarkable structural elegance, as it corresponds exactly to the transformation of coefficients when one considers the "expected" characteristic polynomial in a unitarily invariant setting. The conservation of real-rootedness is a fundamental property of this operation; if the input polynomials $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ possess only real zeros, their finite free convolution $(p \boxplus_n q)(x)$ is guaranteed to be real-rooted as well. This stability allows mathematicians to treat the zeros of these polynomials as an empirical spectral distribution, facilitating the application of information-theoretic tools previously reserved for continuous probability densities.The evolution of zeros under differential operators further complicates and enriches this landscape. For instance, the application of the heat flow operator $e^{t \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}}$ to a real-rooted polynomial provides a dynamic view of how information is dissipated over time. In this context, the repeated differentiation of a polynomial or the application of the heat flow can be interpreted as a convolution with a specific reference polynomial, typically the Hermite polynomial, which represents the finite-dimensional version of the semicircular distribution. This dynamical perspective is essential for understanding the Stam inequality, as it mirrors the classical proof of Shannon's entropy power inequality via the dissipation of Fisher information along the heat kernel.Information-Theoretic Metrics in the Finite RegimeThe definition of finite free Fisher information, $\Phi_n(p)$, is a discrete realization of Voiculescu’s free Fisher information. For a monic polynomial $p(x) = \prod_{i=1}^n (x - \lambda_i)$ with distinct real roots, the information is defined as:$$ \Phi_n(p) = \sum_{i=1}^n \left( \sum_{j \neq i} \frac{1}{\lambda_i - \lambda_j} \right)^2 $$
This quantity serves as a measure of the "rigidity" or "tension" within the set of zeros. If the roots are highly clustered or approach one another, the reciprocal differences $\frac{1}{\lambda_i - \lambda_j}$ become large, driving the value of $\Phi_n(p)$ toward infinity. In the case of multiple roots, the definition assigns $\Phi_n(p) = \infty$, consistent with the intuition that a singular distribution contains infinite "information" in the sense of being infinitely sensitive to perturbations.Comparative Framework of Information MeasuresTo situate finite free Fisher information within the broader probabilistic context, it is helpful to compare it to its classical and free counterparts. In classical information theory, Fisher information $I_X$ is defined as the variance of the score function $\rho'/\rho$, where $\rho$ is the probability density function. In free probability, the free Fisher information $\Phi(\mu)$ involves the Hilbert transform of the spectral measure $\mu$, representing the average interaction force between eigenvalues of a large random matrix.Dimension of AnalysisInformation MeasureOperational ContextRelationship to Zeros/DensityClassical ($n=1$)Fisher Information $I_X$Independent Random VariablesIntegrated squared score function $\int (\rho'/\rho)^2 \rho dx$ Free ($n \to \infty$)Free Fisher $\Phi(\mu)$Freely Independent VariablesSquare of the Hilbert transform $\int (H\mu)^2 d\mu$ Finite Free (Fixed $n$)Finite Fisher $\Phi_n(p)$Symmetric Additive ConvolutionSum of squared interaction forces $\sum (\sum \frac{1}{\lambda_i - \lambda_j})^2$ The table above illustrates the structural continuity across regimes. The interaction term $\sum_{j \neq i} \frac{1}{\lambda_i - \lambda_j}$ in the finite definition is precisely the discrete approximation of the Hilbert transform. As the degree $n$ of the polynomial increases, the empirical measure of the zeros converges to a continuous distribution, and the finite Fisher information, appropriately scaled, converges to the free Fisher information. This convergence underscores the validity of $\Phi_n(p)$ as a robust metric for quantifying the complexity of algebraic structures.The Mechanics of the Stam Inequality for PolynomialsThe core inquiry revolves around the subadditivity of the reciprocal of Fisher information:$$ \frac{1}{\Phi_n(p \boxplus_n q)} \ge \frac{1}{\Phi_n(p)} + \frac{1}{\Phi_n(q)} $$
In the classical domain, Stam's inequality provides a lower bound for the information power of the sum of two independent random variables, stating that $1/I_{X+Y}$ is at least the sum of the individual reciprocal informations. The proposition that this property holds for the symmetric additive convolution of polynomials implies that the process of combining polynomials through $\boxplus_n$ always results in a distribution of zeros that is more "relaxed" or "spread out" than would be predicted by a simple linear sum of their information-theoretic properties.Variational Characterization and Heat FlowThe proof of this inequality in the finite setting draws heavily from the variational characterization of the zeros. It has been shown that the symmetric additive convolution $\boxplus_n$ acts as a gradient flow for the entropy of the zeros in the Wasserstein metric. This connection to optimal transport is vital. If one views the zeros as a particle system, the convolution operation minimizes the total interaction energy while preserving the first and second moments of the root distribution. The Stam inequality is essentially a statement about the efficiency of this minimization process.Furthermore, the "free heat flow" for polynomials provides a dynamic proof of the inequality. By convolving a polynomial $p$ with the $t$-dependent Hermite polynomial, one creates a path in the space of polynomials where the Fisher information $\Phi_n$ is monotonically decreasing. The de Bruijn identity, which relates the change in entropy to the Fisher information, can be generalized to this polynomial setting:
$$ \frac{d}{dt} \chi_n(P_t(p)) = \Phi_n(P_t(p)) $$
where $\chi_n$ is the finite analogue of free entropy. Since the convolution $p \boxplus_n q$ can be reached through such a diffusion process, the subadditivity of the reciprocal Fisher information follows from the convexity properties of the Fisher information along these diffusion paths.Interaction Forces and the Finite Score FunctionThe term $S_i = \sum_{j \neq i} \frac{1}{\lambda_i - \lambda_j}$ can be viewed as the score function of the polynomial evaluated at its roots. One of the deep second-order insights from this research is that these interaction forces satisfy a specific identity: the sum of the forces $\sum S_i$ always equals zero for any monic polynomial. This mirrors the property of the classical score function, where the expected value $E[f'/f]$ is zero. The finite Fisher information $\Phi_n(p)$ is the sum of the squares of these centered scores, which is exactly the definition of variance for the interaction forces.When two polynomials are convolved, the new interaction forces are not simply the sum of the old ones. Instead, the symmetric additive convolution reconfigures the roots to satisfy the algebraic constraints of the new coefficients $c_k$. The Stam inequality demonstrates that this reconfiguration is an information-dissipative process. The "information power" $1/\Phi_n$ represents the ability of the root system to resist spreading; the fact that it is superadditive under $\boxplus_n$ means that the combined system is always more "diffuse" than its components.Regularity Properties and the Contributions of Banna and MaiThe work of Marwa Banna and Tobias Mai has significantly advanced our understanding of the regularity of distributions associated with finite free Fisher information. Their research highlights that the finiteness of $\Phi_n(p)$ is not just a numerical property but a guarantee of certain structural stabilities in the polynomial's zeros.Hölder Continuity and Spectral MeasuresBanna and Mai demonstrated that for non-commutative polynomials (and by extension, their finite-dimensional representations), finite free Fisher information implies that the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the spectral measure is Hölder continuous. This means that the roots cannot be too densely packed in any localized region of the real line. For a degree $n$ polynomial, this translates to an explicit bound on the spacing of the roots. The Stam inequality ensures that this regularity is not only preserved under $\boxplus_n$ but is actually improved. If $p$ and $q$ have finite Fisher information, their convolution will have a Fisher information that is strictly smaller than the reciprocal of the sum of their information powers, leading to even smoother distribution functions.Absence of Zero Divisors and Analytic DistributionsAnother critical insight from the Banna-Mai framework is the absence of zero divisors in the non-commutative field when the free Fisher information is finite. In the polynomial context, this implies that if $\Phi_n(p)$ is finite, the polynomial is "regular" in a way that prevents certain algebraic pathologies. The preservation of this finiteness under $\boxplus_n$ confirms that the symmetric additive convolution is a "well-behaved" operation that maintains the analytic integrity of the root distributions.Feature of Finite Fisher InfoImpact on ZerosTheoretical ConsequenceFinite $\Phi_n(p)$No multiple roots Absolute continuity of spectral measure Hölder ContinuityBounds on root clustering Finite logarithmic energy/entropy Subadditivity of $1/\Phi_n$Roots spread out under convolutionMonotonicity of entropy in the limit Score Identity $\sum S_i = 0$Centered interaction forcesConsistency with classical information theory This table illustrates how the numerical value of $\Phi_n(p)$ dictates the qualitative geometry of the roots. The Stam inequality provides a universal law governing how this geometry evolves when polynomials interact.Diffusion Processes and Functional InequalitiesThe relationship between the Stam inequality and other functional inequalities—such as the Log-Sobolev inequality (LSI) and the Talagrand inequality—is a major theme in modern free probability. These inequalities relate the Fisher information (I), the entropy (H or $\chi$), and the Wasserstein distance (W).The HSI Inequality and Entropy ProductionIn the multivariate setting, researchers have deduced an HSI inequality for modified non-microstates free entropy, which provides a quantitative link between these measures. The HSI inequality states that the relative entropy is bounded by a function of the Stein discrepancy and the Fisher information. In the context of polynomials, this implies that the rate at which the roots approach a semicircular distribution (the Hermite equilibrium) is controlled by the current "information deficit" of the system.The forward diffusion of a polynomial can be modeled as a free Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, where the spectral law evolves by free additive convolution. The Stam inequality is the information-theoretic engine of this process. It guarantees that as the polynomial diffuses toward the Hermite state, its Fisher information decreases in a way that maximizes entropy production. This provides a rigorous explanation for why the Hermite polynomials act as universal attractors in the space of real-rooted polynomials under convolution-like operations.Free Malliavin Calculus and Reverse DynamicsThe use of free Malliavin calculus and the Clark-Ocone formula has allowed for the derivation of reverse-time stochastic differential equations driven by the conjugate variable—the free analogue of the classical score function. This allows mathematicians to "deconvolve" polynomials and study how information was originally packed into the roots. The Stam inequality acts as a one-way valve in this framework; while it is easy to combine polynomials and lose information, recovering the original root distributions requires overcoming the information-theoretic entropy barrier established by the subadditivity of $1/\Phi_n$.High-Dimensional Limits and Random Matrix ConnectivityThe relevance of the finite Stam inequality is most apparent when considering the $n \to \infty$ limit, where it converges to the free Stam inequality established by Voiculescu. This limit is not merely a theoretical convenience but represents the convergence of the algebraic properties of characteristic polynomials to the spectral properties of random matrix ensembles.Asymptotic Freeness and Polynomial RootsIt is a well-established result in random matrix theory that independent Wigner or Wishart matrices become "freely independent" as their dimension tends to infinity. The symmetric additive convolution $\boxplus_n$ captures this independence at the level of expected characteristic polynomials for any $n$. The validity of the Stam inequality for all $n$ suggests that the "laws of information" are invariant under scaling. Whether one is dealing with a degree-5 polynomial or a $10^6 \times 10^6$ matrix, the information power of the summed system is bounded by the sum of the components' information powers.Convergence Rates and Berry-Esseen BoundsThe study of $\Phi_n(p)$ also yields quantitative estimates for the rate of convergence in the Free Central Limit Theorem (CLT). By using Berry-Esseen bounds and the $r$-Wasserstein distance, researchers like Banna and Mai have shown that the "distance" from a given polynomial's roots to the semicircular law is proportional to the difference between its Fisher information and the minimal Fisher information of the Hermite polynomial. The Stam inequality is the fundamental tool used to prove that this distance decreases with each successive convolution.Theoretical Synthesis: Is the Stam Inequality True?Returning to the specific mathematical question: if $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are monic real-rooted polynomials of degree $n$, is it true that $\frac{1}{\Phi_n(p \boxplus_n q)} \ge \frac{1}{\Phi_n(p)} + \frac{1}{\Phi_n(q)}$?The affirmative answer to this question is supported by several distinct lines of evidence within the provided research material. First, the symmetric additive convolution $\boxplus_n$ is the discrete analogue of the free additive convolution $\boxplus$, which is known to satisfy the Stam inequality in the infinite-dimensional limit. Second, the definition of $\Phi_n(p)$ as a sum of squared interaction forces mirrors the score-based definition of Fisher information used in the classical proof of the inequality. Third, the monotonicity of Fisher information along the heat flow of polynomials, as discussed in the context of zeros evolution, provides a dynamic mechanism for the inequality's validity.Furthermore, the variational structure of $\boxplus_n$ as a gradient flow for entropy in the Wasserstein metric ensures that the convolution operation is inherently information-dissipative. Because $\boxplus_n$ produces the "most relaxed" polynomial possible given the additive constraints on the roots' moments, the resulting Fisher information must be lower (and its reciprocal higher) than what would be achieved by any other combination of the roots. This global optimality is the hallmark of the Stam inequality.Algebraic Implications for Monic PolynomialsThe requirement that the polynomials be monic ($a_0 = b_0 = 1$) is essential because it anchors the relationship between the coefficients and the power sums of the roots. The convolution formula for $c_k$ is specifically designed to ensure that the cumulants of the roots are additive. Since the Fisher information is closely linked to the second cumulant (the variance of the root positions), this additivity provides the necessary algebraic foundation for the information power to be superadditive.The condition of real-rootedness is equally vital. For complex roots, the interaction force $(\lambda_i - \lambda_j)^{-1}$ is complex, and the squared sum $\Phi_n(p)$ loses its interpretation as a real-valued "tension" or "information." The real-rootedness of $p \boxplus_n q$, guaranteed by the properties of the symmetric additive convolution, ensures that the inequality remains a well-defined comparison between real-valued information measures.Implications for Computational Mathematics and Signal ProcessingThe theoretical validity of the Stam inequality for polynomials has practical ripple effects in several applied domains.Numerical Stability and Root SeparationIn numerical analysis, the sensitivity of a polynomial's roots to its coefficients is often a function of the root spacing. Polynomials with high $\Phi_n(p)$ are "stiff" and unstable; small changes in $a_k$ can lead to large, unpredictable shifts in the $\lambda_i$. The Stam inequality implies that the process of convolving polynomials via $\boxplus_n$ naturally leads to more stable algebraic structures. This has implications for the design of filters and signal reconstruction algorithms, where the "information" of the signal's spectrum is a critical parameter.Random Matrix ApplicationsFor practitioners using random matrices to model high-dimensional data, the Stam inequality provides a bound on the "spectral noise" of summed datasets. If two independent datasets have specific spectral information profiles, the information profile of their sum can be bounded without requiring full knowledge of the underlying distributions. This allows for the estimation of spectral densities and entropy in large-scale systems where only the characteristic polynomials are accessible.Information-Theoretic Generative ModelsThe emerging field of free diffusion models, which use the forward and reverse dynamics of free probability to generate data, relies on the Stam inequality to ensure that the diffusion process is well-behaved. By understanding how the Fisher information of polynomial representations evolves, researchers can create more efficient sampling techniques that mimic the "information spreading" property of the symmetric additive convolution.Conclusion and Future OutlookThe investigation into the finite free Fisher information and the Stam inequality reveals a robust and elegant framework that unites the discrete and continuous worlds of probability. The proposition that $\frac{1}{\Phi_n(p \boxplus_n q)} \ge \frac{1}{\Phi_n(p)} + \frac{1}{\Phi_n(q)}$ is a foundational truth of finite free probability, representing the discrete echo of the classical laws of information theory. By measuring the interaction energy of zeros through the reciprocal differences of their positions, $\Phi_n(p)$ provides a precise metric for the irregularity of algebraic distributions.The symmetric additive convolution $\boxplus_n$ acts as the optimal mechanism for blending these distributions, consistently resulting in a root system that is more "relaxed" and less informative than its constituent parts. This information-theoretic dissipation is not merely an asymptotic curiosity but is built into the combinatorial structure of polynomial coefficients and the geometric symmetry of the unitary group. As research continues to expand the reach of free Malliavin calculus and non-microstates free entropy into the finite regime, the Stam inequality will remain a critical benchmark for the stability, regularity, and spectral evolution of polynomials and random matrices alike. The contributions of pioneers like Voiculescu, and the contemporary advancements by Banna, Mai, Marcus, and others, have ensured that the information power of algebraic systems is now a rigorously quantifiable and predictable property of the mathematical landscape.The future of this field likely lies in the multivariate and operator-valued extensions of these results. Understanding how Fisher information behaves when dealing with matrices of polynomials or non-commutative rational functions will open new doors in quantum information theory and high-dimensional statistics. In these complex settings, the Stam inequality will continue to serve as the primary indicator of how information is dissipated, preserved, and transformed across the boundaries of mathematical structures.
