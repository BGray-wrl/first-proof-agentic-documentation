Structural Incompatibility of Uniform Lattices Containing Torsion with Rationally Acyclic Universal Covers of Compact ManifoldsThe inquiry into whether a uniform lattice $\Gamma$ in a real semi-simple Lie group $G$ containing 2-torsion can function as the fundamental group of a compact manifold $M$ without boundary, such that its universal cover $\tilde{M}$ is acyclic over the rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$, necessitates an exhaustive examination of the topological and algebraic constraints governing discrete group actions on manifolds. This problem sits at the intersection of several profound mathematical theories: the rigidity of lattices in semi-simple Lie groups, the homological finiteness properties of discrete groups, and the classical Smith theory concerning fixed points of transformation groups.In the context of this analysis, a uniform (or cocompact) lattice $\Gamma$ is a discrete subgroup of a real semi-simple Lie group $G$ where the quotient space $\Gamma \backslash G$ is compact. Such groups are ubiquitous in geometry and number theory, particularly within the framework of symmetric spaces $X = G/K$, where $K$ is a maximal compact subgroup of $G$. The requirement that $\Gamma$ contains 2-torsion implies the existence of elements $g \in \Gamma$ such that $g^2 = 1$ and $g \neq 1$. The rational acyclicity of the universal cover $\tilde{M}$ means that its reduced homology with rational coefficients vanishes: $\tilde{H}_i(\tilde{M}; \mathbb{Q}) = 0$ for all $i \geq 0$. This condition is a homological relaxation of contractibility, which would characterize $M$ as an aspherical manifold.Evidence suggests that for a uniform lattice containing torsion, the existence of such a manifold $M$ is fundamentally obstructed. The obstruction arises from a conflict between the necessary conditions for a group to act freely on a $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclic space and the geometric rigidity of lattices that forces finite subgroups to have non-vanishing fixed-point set Euler characteristics.Geometric Framework of Semi-Simple Groups and LatticesTo evaluate the possibility of $\Gamma$ acting as the fundamental group of a manifold $M$, one must first understand the intrinsic geometry of the group $G$ and the lattice $\Gamma$. A real semi-simple Lie group $G$ (assumed to be connected and without compact factors) acts transitively on its associated Riemannian symmetric space $X = G/K$. The space $X$ is a complete, simply connected Riemannian manifold with non-positive sectional curvature, making it a CAT(0) space. By the Cartan-Hadamard theorem, $X$ is diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$, where $n = \dim(G/K)$, and is therefore contractible.Every uniform lattice $\Gamma$ in $G$ acts properly discontinuously and cocompactly on $X$. If $\Gamma$ were torsion-free, the quotient $X/\Gamma$ would be a compact aspherical manifold with fundamental group $\pi_1(X/\Gamma) \cong \Gamma$ and universal cover $X$. In this scenario, $X$ is contractible and thus $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclic, providing a trivial positive answer to the query for the torsion-free case. However, the presence of 2-torsion in $\Gamma$ significantly alters the landscape. Selberg's Lemma ensures that $\Gamma$ is virtually torsion-free, containing a torsion-free subgroup $\Gamma_0$ of finite index. But the full group $\Gamma$, by virtue of its torsion, cannot act freely on the contractible space $X$. The Cartan fixed point theorem for non-positively curved spaces dictates that every finite subgroup $H \subset \Gamma$ must have a non-empty fixed point set $X^H$.Finiteness Properties and Rational DualityThe homological nature of $\Gamma$ is captured by its finiteness properties. While $\Gamma$ is not of type $F$ (since it has torsion), it is of type $VF$ (virtually $F$) and consequently of type $VFP$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. This allows for the calculation of the rational Euler characteristic $\chi(\Gamma)$, often termed the Euler-Poincaré measure of the lattice. If $M$ is a compact manifold with fundamental group $\Gamma$ and a $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclic universal cover, the manifold $M$ would serve as a "rational classifying space" for $\Gamma$. In such a case, the Euler characteristic of the manifold $\chi(M)$ must coincide with the rational Euler characteristic of the group $\Gamma$.Group PropertyTorsion-Free Lattice (Γtf​)Lattice with Torsion (Γtor​)Finiteness ClassType $F$Type $VF$ / $VFP$Cohomological Dimension$cd_{\mathbb{Q}}(\Gamma) = \dim(X)$$vcd_{\mathbb{Q}}(\Gamma) = \dim(X)$Euler Characteristic$\chi(\Gamma) \in \mathbb{Z}$$\chi(\Gamma) \in \mathbb{Q}$Classifying SpaceFinite complex $B\Gamma$ existsOnly $E\Gamma$ for proper actionsPoincaré Duality$PD_n(\mathbb{Z})$$VPD_n(\mathbb{Z})$ / $PD_n(\mathbb{Q})$The rational Euler characteristic of a lattice can be a non-integer. For example, the lattice $SL(2, \mathbb{Z})$ has $\chi(SL(2, \mathbb{Z})) = -1/12$. Since the Euler characteristic of a compact manifold $\chi(M)$ must be an integer (as it is the alternating sum of Betti numbers of a finite CW-complex), any lattice $\Gamma$ with a non-integral $\chi(\Gamma)$ is immediately disqualified from being the fundamental group of a compact manifold with a $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclic universal cover. However, even for lattices where $\chi(\Gamma) \in \mathbb{Z}$ (such as those where the rank of $G$ and $K$ differ in a way that forces $\chi = 0$), deeper obstructions persist.The Theory of $\mathbb{Q}$-Acyclic Universal CoversA manifold $M$ whose universal cover $\tilde{M}$ is $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclic is a significant object in geometric topology. If $\tilde{M}$ were contractible, $M$ would be an aspherical manifold. The relaxation to $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclicity allows for $\tilde{M}$ to have non-trivial integral homology $H_*(\tilde{M}; \mathbb{Z})$, provided that this homology consists entirely of torsion. This situation typically arises in the study of Bestvina-Brady groups, where a group is constructed to act freely on a $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclic complex that is not contractible.For $\Gamma$ to be the fundamental group of $M = \tilde{M}/\Gamma$, the group $\Gamma$ must act freely and properly discontinuously on $\tilde{M}$. If $\Gamma$ contains an element of order 2, say $\tau$, then $\tau$ must act as a fixed-point-free involution on $\tilde{M}$. According to classical Smith theory, a finite $p$-group acting on a $\mathbb{Z}/p$-acyclic space must have a fixed point. While rational acyclicity does not imply $\mathbb{Z}/2$-acyclicity, the requirement of a free action on a $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclic space for a group with torsion is subject to the necessary conditions discovered by Jim Fowler.Fowler’s Obstruction for Rational Poincaré Duality GroupsThe research of Jim Fowler, particularly in the extension of Bestvina-Brady theory to $\mathbb{Q}$-Poincaré duality groups, provides a definitive constraint. Fowler examined groups $\Gamma$ that are extensions of a torsion-free group $\pi$ by a finite group $G$. For $\Gamma$ to be the fundamental group of a compact manifold with $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclic universal cover, $\Gamma$ must be a $PD_n(\mathbb{Q})$ group. However, a lattice with torsion is already known to be a $PD_n(\mathbb{Q})$ group. The critical question is whether it admits a free action on a $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclic manifold.Fowler’s main theorem implies that if $\Gamma$ acts freely and cocompactly on a $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclic space, then for every non-trivial cyclic subgroup $H \subset \Gamma$ of finite order, the Euler characteristic of the fixed point set of $H$ on the "natural" contractible space for $\Gamma$ must vanish. For a uniform lattice $\Gamma$, the natural contractible space is the symmetric space $X = G/K$. The finite subgroups of $\Gamma$ act on $X$ by isometries, and since $X$ has non-positive curvature, the fixed point set $X^H$ of any finite subgroup $H$ is non-empty and contractible.The Euler characteristic of a contractible set is always 1. Thus, for any torsion element $h \in \Gamma$, we have:$$\chi(X^{\langle h \rangle}) = 1$$
This non-vanishing Euler characteristic ($\chi = 1 \neq 0$) serves as a topological obstruction. Fowler demonstrates that the vanishing of these fixed-point Euler characteristics is a necessary condition for the existence of a free action on a rationally acyclic space. Since lattices in semi-simple Lie groups consistently yield fixed-point sets with $\chi = 1$, they cannot act freely on any rationally acyclic space, including the universal cover of a compact manifold.Comparative Analysis of Lattices and Fixed-Point SetsThe behavior of fixed point sets is determined by the rank of the semi-simple Lie group and its maximal compact subgroup. A fundamental distinction exists between groups of equal rank and those where the rank of $G$ exceeds the rank of $K$.Group TypeRank ConditionEuler Char χ(X)Fixed Set χ(XH)Type 1$rank(G) = rank(K)$Non-zero1 (Contractible)Type 2$rank(G) > rank(K)$Zero1 (Contractible)In Type 1 groups, such as $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$, where $K = SO(2)$, the rank of $G$ is 1 and the rank of $K$ is 1. The Euler characteristic of the lattice $\chi(\Gamma)$ is generally non-zero and non-integral. The fixed point set of a torsion element in the hyperbolic plane $X = \mathbb{H}^2$ is a single point, hence $\chi = 1$. This non-vanishing value precludes a free action on a $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclic manifold.In Type 2 groups, such as $SL(3, \mathbb{R})$, where $K = SO(3)$, the rank of $G$ is 2 while the rank of $K$ is 1. For such groups, the Euler characteristic $\chi(\Gamma)$ is zero. One might hypothesize that this vanishing Euler characteristic allows for the construction of a manifold $M$. However, the 2-torsion elements in $\Gamma$ still act on the symmetric space $X = SL(3, \mathbb{R})/SO(3)$ with contractible fixed point sets. The Fowler obstruction is independent of the global Euler characteristic $\chi(\Gamma)$ and depends specifically on the local fixed-point data $\chi(X^H)$. As long as finite subgroups fix contractible sets, the group cannot act freely on a $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclic manifold.Homological Torsion Growth and $L^2$-InvariantsThe study of $L^2$-Betti numbers $b_i^{(2)}(\Gamma)$ further illuminates the incompatibility. For a manifold $M$ with rationally acyclic universal cover, all $L^2$-Betti numbers of the fundamental group $\Gamma$ must vanish. This is consistent with the vanishing of $\chi(\Gamma)$ for groups of Type 2. However, recent advances in homology torsion growth suggest that for groups with torsion acting on contractible complexes, the "normalized" torsion in homology does not vanish, but rather reflects the topology of the fixed-point sets.Lück’s approximation theorem provides a bridge between the Betti numbers of finite covers and $L^2$-Betti numbers. If $\Gamma$ were the fundamental group of a $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclic cover $\tilde{M}$, then for any nested chain of normal subgroups $\Gamma_k \subset \Gamma$, the normalized Betti numbers $b_i(M_k; \mathbb{Q})$ would necessarily limit to zero. For lattices in semi-simple groups, this occurs when $b_i^{(2)}(\Gamma) = 0$. But while the $L^2$-Betti numbers may vanish, the torsion growth in $H_*(M_k; \mathbb{Z})$ remains high, often scaling linearly with the index of the cover. This integral complexity is often the "shadow" of the fixed points of the torsion elements in the original action on $X$.Analytic Torsion and Arithmetic LatticesAnalytic torsion, introduced by Ray and Singer, is a metric-dependent invariant that generalizes the Reidemeister torsion. For arithmetic manifolds, analytic torsion is deeply connected to the volume of the manifold and the $L^2$-torsion of the universal cover. If a lattice $\Gamma$ with torsion could act freely on a $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclic manifold $\tilde{M}$, then the $L^2$-torsion of $\Gamma$ would have to be consistent with the combinatorial torsion of a rationally acyclic complex.However, the $L^2$-torsion $\rho^{(2)}(\Gamma)$ for a lattice with torsion is generally non-zero and reflects the specific volume of the symmetric space $X$. In contrast, a $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclic manifold that is not aspherical typically exhibits different $L^2$-torsion characteristics. The combination of geometric rigidity (fixing the $L^2$-torsion via the Lie group $G$) and topological requirements for $M$ creates a mismatch that suggests the lattice cannot be realized as the fundamental group of such a manifold.Bestvina-Brady Theory and the Construction of Acyclic SpacesThe work of Bestvina and Brady (1997) provided the first examples of groups that are of type $FP$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ but not over $\mathbb{Z}$, constructed as kernels of maps from right-angled Artin groups to $\mathbb{Z}$. These groups act freely and cocompactly on $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclic complexes. Fowler applied these ideas to "thicken" these complexes into manifolds using a variant of the Davis reflection group trick.The Bestvina-Brady kernel $\Gamma_{BB}$ acts on a subcomplex $X_L$ of a product of trees. If the link $L$ of the Artin group is $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclic but not contractible, then $X_L$ is $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclic and not contractible. One can then take a "thickened" version of the quotient $K = X_L / \Gamma_{BB}$ and apply the reflection group trick to produce a group $\Gamma^*$ that satisfies Poincaré duality over $\mathbb{Q}$.Crucially, in Fowler's construction, the resulting group $\Gamma^*$ is torsion-free. The torsion elements that were used in the reflection group trick (to generate the "mirrors") are eliminated when passing to a torsion-free subgroup of finite index to ensure the action is free. If one attempted to keep the 2-torsion elements, the resulting space would not be a manifold without boundary, but rather an orbifold or a manifold with boundary (the fixed point sets of the reflections).The Acyclic Reflection Group TrickThe reflection group trick, developed by Michael Davis, starts with a compact manifold with faces $P$ and a Coxeter group $W$. The construction produces a manifold $\mathcal{M}(W, P) = (W \times P) / \sim$ where $(w, x) \sim (ws_i, x)$ if $x$ lies on the $i$-th face of $P$. If $P$ is contractible and the nerve of the faces is a sphere, the resulting manifold is contractible.Fowler replaced the contractible $P$ with a $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclic space $K$.Start with a $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclic Bestvina-Brady complex.Thicken it to a manifold $N$ with boundary.Glue copies of $N$ together using a reflection group.The resulting manifold $W$ has a $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclic universal cover.The fundamental group $\pi_1(W)$ is a semi-direct product $\Gamma \rtimes W'$, where $W'$ is a torsion-free subgroup of the reflection group.In every such successful construction, the torsion elements are removed to allow for a free action on the manifold. If the 2-torsion remains, it necessarily fixes the "mirrors" (the faces where the gluing occurred), making the action non-free. This confirms that while one can construct groups with "manifold-like" properties using torsion elements, those torsion elements cannot belong to the fundamental group of a manifold that acts freely on the acyclic cover.Rigidity and Fundamental Group ConstraintsUniform lattices in semi-simple Lie groups of rank $\geq 2$ are subject to Margulis Superrigidity, which implies that their finite-dimensional representations are very restricted. If a lattice $\Gamma$ were the fundamental group of a compact manifold $M$ with $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclic universal cover, this would imply a very specific action on the cohomology of $M$.Since $\tilde{M}$ is $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclic, the rational cohomology of $M$ is isomorphic to the rational cohomology of the group $\Gamma$.$$H^i(M; \mathbb{Q}) \cong H^i(\Gamma; \mathbb{Q})$$
For a manifold $M$, the cohomology must satisfy Poincaré duality over $\mathbb{Z}$. However, the rational cohomology of a lattice with torsion often reflects the cohomology of the symmetric space $X$ (which vanishes in many degrees) and the cohomology of the finite subgroups (which may be non-trivial). The interaction between the torsion in the fundamental group and the integral homology of $M$ is constrained by the Universal Coefficient Theorem. If $H_i(M; \mathbb{Q}) = 0$, then $H_i(M; \mathbb{Z})$ must be a torsion group.For a lattice with torsion, the group cohomology $H^*(\Gamma; \mathbb{Q})$ is well-defined and finite-dimensional. But if $\Gamma$ contains 2-torsion, it contains a subgroup $C_2$. The cohomology of $C_2$ with integer coefficients is non-vanishing in all even degrees: $H^{2k}(C_2; \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z}/2$. If $M$ were a $K(\Gamma, 1)$ in the rational sense, the torsion in $H^*(M; \mathbb{Z})$ would have to account for all the torsion in the group cohomology. In a compact manifold, the homology groups $H_i(M; \mathbb{Z})$ are finitely generated. Thus, they can only contain a finite amount of torsion. A group with torsion, however, typically has non-vanishing cohomology in infinitely many degrees when considered over $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Z}/p$.This creates a "Finiteness Mismatch":Group Requirement: $H^*(\Gamma; \mathbb{Z})$ is non-zero for infinitely many degrees due to the presence of 2-torsion (subgroup $C_2$).Manifold Requirement: $M$ is a finite CW-complex, so $H_i(M; \mathbb{Z}) = 0$ for $i > \dim(M)$.Rational Acyclicity: $H_i(M; \mathbb{Q}) = 0$ for $i > 0$ if the cover is $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclic (assuming $\Gamma$ has the rational homology of a point).The only way for $\Gamma$ to be the fundamental group of a finite complex $M$ is for $B\Gamma$ to be finite-dimensional, which requires $\Gamma$ to be torsion-free. If $\Gamma$ has torsion, it cannot have a finite-dimensional classifying space $B\Gamma$, and thus cannot act freely on any finite-dimensional contractible space. While the universal cover $\tilde{M}$ is only required to be $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclic, the finite dimensionality of $M$ and the presence of torsion in $\Gamma$ still collide via Smith theory and the transfer map.The Transfer Map and Rational IsomorphismFor any finite-index subgroup $\Gamma_0 \subset \Gamma$, there is a transfer map $tr: H^*(\Gamma_0; \mathbb{Q}) \to H^*(\Gamma; \mathbb{Q})$ which is surjective. If $\Gamma$ acts freely on a $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclic space $X$, then $\Gamma_0$ also acts freely on $X$. Since $\Gamma_0$ can be chosen to be torsion-free, $X/\Gamma_0$ is an aspherical manifold. The rational homology of $\Gamma$ is thus a summand of the rational homology of the torsion-free subgroup $\Gamma_0$.However, for a lattice, the torsion-free subgroup $\Gamma_0$ satisfies Poincaré duality over $\mathbb{Z}$ for $n = \dim(X)$. The full group $\Gamma$ also satisfies rational Poincaré duality for the same $n$. But the free action of $\Gamma$ on a $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclic space $\tilde{M}$ requires $\Gamma$ to behave as a torsion-free group of type $F$ from the perspective of rational homotopy theory. The "algebraic 2-torsion" in $\Gamma$ creates a discrepancy in the equivariant cohomology that can only be resolved if the torsion elements have fixed points.Summary of Constraints on Lattices with TorsionThe impossibility of the proposed scenario is underscored by several converging lines of evidence.Constraint CategoryMechanism of ObstructionRelevant ResultIntegrality$\chi(\Gamma)$ must be an integer for a manifold $M$ to exist.Euler-Poincaré Measure Fixed Point TheoryTorsion elements in lattices fix contractible sets ($\chi = 1$).Cartan Fixed Point Theorem Rational AcyclicityFree actions on $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclic spaces require fixed set $\chi = 0$.Fowler’s Theorem Finiteness TypeTorsion requires infinite-dimensional integral cohomology.Smith Theory / Type $F$ RigidityLattices are geometrically tied to $G/K$ with $\chi_{fixed} \neq 0$.Mostow Rigidity / CAT(0) The most salient of these is the Fowler obstruction. In the construction of a manifold $M$, the universal cover $\tilde{M}$ is a $\Gamma$-space. If the action is free, then for any torsion-free subgroup $\Gamma_0$, the quotient $\tilde{M}/\Gamma_0$ is a manifold with $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclic cover, making $\Gamma_0$ a $PD_n(\mathbb{Q})$ group. This is consistent with lattices. However, the extension to the full group $\Gamma$ via the finite quotient $G = \Gamma/\Gamma_0$ requires that the action of $G$ on $B\Gamma_0$ (which is $G/K$) has vanishing Euler characteristics on all fixed point sets. Because $G$ acts on the contractible symmetric space $X$, every fixed point set $X^H$ is contractible and thus $\chi(X^H) = 1$. This value is never zero, regardless of the rank or type of the semi-simple Lie group.Case Study: $SL(2, \mathbb{C})$ and $PSL(2, \mathbb{C})$ LatticesLattices in $PSL(2, \mathbb{C})$ are the fundamental groups of 3-dimensional hyperbolic manifolds or orbifolds. Since the dimension is odd, the $L^2$-Betti numbers of these lattices vanish, and their Euler characteristic $\chi(\Gamma)$ is zero.If $\Gamma \subset PSL(2, \mathbb{C})$ contains 2-torsion, it acts on the hyperbolic 3-space $\mathbb{H}^3$. The torsion elements are elliptic isometries that fix a geodesic (an $\mathbb{H}^1$ inside $\mathbb{H}^3$). This fixed point set is contractible, so its Euler characteristic is $\chi(\mathbb{H}^1) = 1$.
To form a compact 3-manifold $M$ without boundary with $\Gamma = \pi_1(M)$, the action of $\Gamma$ on the universal cover $\tilde{M}$ must be free. If $\tilde{M}$ is $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclic, then $\tilde{M}$ must be $\mathbb{Z}$-acyclic in dimension 3 (since $H_1(\tilde{M})$ is zero by simple connectivity and $H_2(\tilde{M})$ must be zero by Poincaré duality for acyclic covers). A $\mathbb{Z}$-acyclic 3-manifold is contractible.By Gottlieb’s theorem, if a group acts freely on a contractible CW-complex and the quotient is a finite complex, the group must be torsion-free. Thus, in the 3-dimensional hyperbolic case, the presence of 2-torsion directly contradicts the existence of a manifold with a $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclic universal cover.Theoretical Outlook and ConclusionThe synthesis of the research indicates that the answer to the query is no. It is not possible for a uniform lattice $\Gamma$ in a real semi-simple group $G$ to be the fundamental group of a compact manifold without boundary whose universal cover is rationally acyclic if $\Gamma$ contains 2-torsion.This conclusion rests on the algebraic and topological rigidity of lattices. A uniform lattice is inextricably linked to its action on the symmetric space $X = G/K$. Any manifold $M$ with $\pi_1(M) = \Gamma$ would imply a free action of $\Gamma$ on $\tilde{M}$. If $\tilde{M}$ is $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclic, $\Gamma$ must satisfy the conditions for a free action on a rationally acyclic space. The governing condition for such an action involves the Euler characteristics of the fixed point sets of finite subgroups acting on the group's classifying space.Because the classifying space for a lattice's torsion-free subgroup is the contractible symmetric space $X$, the finite subgroups of the lattice necessarily have contractible fixed point sets. The Euler characteristic of a contractible set is 1, whereas the existence of a free action on a rationally acyclic space requires this value to be 0. This discrepancy is a universal feature of lattices in semi-simple Lie groups, arising from the non-positive curvature of $G/K$ and the Cartan fixed point theorem. Consequently, the 2-torsion in $\Gamma$ creates a fixed-point obstruction that prevents $\Gamma$ from serving as the fundamental group of any compact manifold with a rationally acyclic universal cover.
